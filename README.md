### About Readar, from the Developer
During Fall 2018, I took a Style in Technical Writing class. During the class we read Dr. Joe Glaser's, "Understanding Style: Practical Ways to Improve Your Writing". In Dr. Glaser's book, he describes a technique for identifying "breath units"; the ratio of syllables to words. 

When we read a document, we subvocalize (read in our head) each sentence in a similar way to how we speak. When sentences are too long we "run out of breath", or we have to reread the sentence. When a sentence is short, it's abrupt, jarring, and can make the reader fumble. Breath units can give you clues about where the meter of your document is, if you want to transfer meaning to the reader, then you have to bring sentences closer to the meter of the whole document. A document with a consistent meter is pleasant to read, as long as it still contains variety. Variety in breath length can make a document engaging; too much variety and the document is hard to read. Not enough variety; the document is bland and often repetitive. If breath units are used effectively, writers can develop engaging material that reader enjoy. 

I used this concept to analyze a "style artifact". This artifact was an assignment from a previous class that we were to analyze and demonstrate style techniques we had learned over the course of the class. 

I decided to calculate the breath units from each sentence of the original assignemnt, and every major revision I made. I took the word count and syllable count of each sentence and made an excel spreadsheet of the data. I then graphed the data to get a visual representation of the body of the document.  

In paragraph two of the original document, there are three noticeable spikes near sentence 2, 5, and 10.

By expanding the sentence, we notice a smoother transition from sentence 9 to sentence 11.

By reducing the size of sentence 2 and sentence 5, we notice a smoother (but still bumpy) transition between the opening of the paragraph to the middle of the body. After both revisions, the graph has a sinusoidal-like shape that gives the writer an idea of the variety of meter over the length of the paragraph.

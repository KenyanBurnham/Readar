                          That morning I walked into work and impatiently fumbled to turn on the monitor I had just installed to the camera DVR. I sat for an hour pouring over the footage until I saw it. The previous night, I had reinstalled the camera system in the laboratory I managed after it had sat inaccessible for six years. I had also instructed a graduate student, whom I had sparred with on policy violations for months, that she was on thin ice and that one slip-up and she would have her access revoked. Approximately nine that evening, she opened the door, let in a friend, and then proceeded to share a candy bar with her friend. Sitting in the trashcan the next morning, was the candy bar wrapper. The morning I reviewed the footage, I shared the video with the director of the program that I worked for. The next day, that student was sent home: permanently.
                          </br> </br> It started five years earlier. I was working as a student assistant in an engineering lab. The university had decided to make a huge push to re-invigorate its safety programs and they toured labs across the university to find a posterchild. When our laboratory was shut down by the college for safety violations, it had come as a shock. We were delivered several pieces of literature that stated very clearly in mixed bolded, highlighted, and red underlined text saying that we had broken all of these rules. To re-open our facility, we needed to address the violations and write a laboratory safety manual. Not a soul in my group wanted to do it, and no one really knew where these rules were coming from. I volunteered to write the manual and I started investigating these mysterious rules we had unknowingly violated.
                          </br> </br> I spent four months pouring through operational manuals from the department, the university, the state, and the federal government. None of it made sense; I wasn't a writer, and none of these documents were written in "English". This language used English words, but it certainly was not English. I spent months pouring through the literature and examples of lab safety manuals and work action safety plans; the driest literature that ever existed. Over time, I was able to produce a somewhat legible document purporting itself to be a safety manual. In a summer I was able to re-open our laboratory. Not only had we corrected our behavior, but we had been the first lab to turn in a safety manual to the department. My manual was disseminated across the department and then the college. I was scooped up by the department itself to write these manuals full-time. Fast-forward a few months and I was sending edits to the regulating bodies on campus; I highlighted and corrected statements, put them in the right tense, left notes about what regulations they were not including from state and federal requirements. I was elevated to a new status, I had a twenty-five-cent promotion, and I didn't have a degree. All because I was literate in a set of documents that no one else could, or wanted, to read. I could read the operation manual for the university and I could translate it to any laboratory.
                          </br> </br> I started wearing boots and button-up shirts, I had a latch on my belt where I held all of my keys, clinking as I walked, I would show people that I had access; and access was power. I started carrying a notebook that I wrote meeting notes, infractions, and policy changes that I would enact later. I cited the manuals in conversation, and I used the language of the manuals to reinforce what I wanted, justifying it with the legislation I had edited and interpreted. I was both the legislative and executive branch of the department. In total, I wrote five safety manuals for six laboratories. I served on internal committees, taught secondary students how to compete with similar manuals, I was appointed to a full-time staff position while I was still pursuing my bachelor's degree, and I was asked by the college to provide the first drafts for newly acquired facilities. But that wasn't the story for everyone else.
                          </br> </br> In the lab to my right, a group of four international students stood around while one guy worked on their testing project. Another group member was on the phone with someone and was giving the only other working group member directions. Their voices got more and more agitated as they worked on the project. I turned up the volume of my headphones so I could drown out their conversation. Then I heard a knock, the group member on the phone hung it up and opened the door. I turned to see who it was, as I knew there was not another lab reservation for a good while. It was another international student that I did not know, and he was wearing flip-flops. I knew everyone who was supposed to be in the lab and it was not him. I paused my music and stood up. Simultaneously, I was met by my coworker who asked if I wanted to grab lunch. I agreed but needed to handle this situation first. I went into the lab and confronted the new guy who said he was helping them with their project. Overlooking the fact that this was blatant cheating, I asked him to leave as he was not supposed to be there and was wearing flip-flops in a laboratory. As he, my coworker, and I left the lab, he said he would wait for his friends to finish their work. Halfway down the hall, I look back to see a single flip-flipped foot being pulled into the lab before the door was shut. I asked my coworker to wait up as I turned around and started walking back, prepared for the kind of confrontation I hate the most.
                          </br> </br> Fast-forward five years and on a daily basis, I run head-to-head with international graduate students about what they could and could not do in the laboratories. These students tried working when I was not there, they let their friends in to the lab to work on projects despite having no class or relation to our program, and they borrowed keys from personnel who had been given temporary access (and who then lost their access); all of these actions I saw as direct attempts to circumvent the rules that were in place. In hindsight, these students were not totally to blame; they were me five years prior. They had no grasp of this kind of English. When I sent students out of laboratories for wearing sandals and for bringing in sodas, they had no context.
                          </br> </br> Every semester, I always bumped into the same international student who had once been in the lab and he always asked me "Do you still work for that lab?". I was always bewildered by this question and answered "yeah", and it wasn't until later that I realized that he was really asking. Before I had begun working for that lab, there was no literature that defined the rules. Students from across the department would get access to this lab and use the equipment when no one else was around. But as soon as there was literature and someone to enforce it, they lost access that had been in place for over ten years. I had disrupted a way of success that had previously been there for generations of students and through my actions many of these students had to repeat classes or were stripped of funding and sent back to their home country. Worse still, these students had no way of regaining their access because they did not speak or read the language as well as I, nor did they understand the language of regulations and departmental politics as I had mastered. Every time a student took issue with me or tried to get me fired, they lost because I had the rules on my side; because I translated and interpreted them in the first place. The department and the university staff I worked with had never questioned my interpretation of the rules and regulations and so I became a barrier that could not be moved. The student who asked me every semester if I worked for that lab was really asking: "Is the nightmare over?".
                          </br> </br> A knock on the door takes my focus for a brief moment before I see my coworker go to get the door. I return my attention back to my inventory spreadsheet. I hear a quiet voice behind me; "Excuse me sir?". I look back and I am greeted by an absolutely tiny student who is visibly shaking. Typically, I would stand up to greet new students and faculty, as I had learned that commanding attention and showing respect often involved visual cues and standing up to greet people was usually an easy way to convey either message. I decide to stay seated instead, based on advice I had received from my six-foot-eight tall friend who was prone to unintentionally intimidating people. I asked the student what I could do for them, and they fumble to try and explain. They explain that they are a PhD candidate working for another professor who has directed them to secure access to our lab to use our equipment. I tell them to have their advisor send me an email formally asking for permission to access the lab. They look like they are on the verge of tears. I explain in a reassuring voice that it is just common practice to have formal written consent and it helps me to keep track of the keys I distribute. What I don't try to explain is that it is written in the university procedures (and my own manuals) that no one should have access to a space unless they are given explicit permission by the lab safety manager (myself) or the workspace manager (my supervisor). She nods her head that she understands, says thank you, and leaves. Shortly thereafter, I get an angry email from their advisor, with my supervisor and the department chair copied on it, demanding that I explain why I turned away their student.
                          </br> </br> As innocuous as knowing how to read a university operational procedure is, it played a huge role in the politics that shaped my life and the life of those in that engineering department. Lab safety manuals are only partial summaries of larger institution's rules specialized to a given space. They are invisible documents that no one reads and yet everyone is held accountable for. They are gatekeeping documents that control the lives of individuals that traverse their territory and they ensnare the lives of people desperate for power and advancement. Understanding what they mean is difficult, even for a native speaker of the language in which it is written. These documents are not inherently racialized and are usually written in neutral third-person language. However, I personally witnessed how one's ability to read in a specific domain can serve to marginalize a group; and I reconcile that I did contributed to that marginalization. Worst still, I was encouraged by my institution and my superiors to continue how I enacted the literature as it improved their station. The various lab manuals that float in esoteric corners of engineering labs provide a protective layer that shields the workspace owners from litigation and political damages. As I provided protective layers for faculty, they would encourage me to continue pursuing new writing domains in other lab spaces. And as my ability to dive further into this specific literacy domain, I experienced what the power of literacy was in raising my own station, at the detriment of others. Sometimes, I think about the girl I sent home all those years ago with guilt that can only be granted to those with the privilege of an innocuous literacy.

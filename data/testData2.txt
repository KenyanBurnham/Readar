Un-named Project 1 - A lightChapter 1: StrangerDrip drip drip. The rain hit softly on the corrugated tin awning. Ara shifted her dad's sleeping bag around not wanting to face today. Drip drip drip. "ughhh" she said aloud. Ara sat up and rubbed her eyes. She looked around her makeshift sleeping chambers inside an old rusted out vehicle and listened for a moment. Drip drip drip... clunk. They smelled her. Her eyes bolted wide open, she had to rummage the place fast and stealthily if she was going to get out. She pulled on her torn Converse and zipped up her vest as quietly as possible. Grabbing her satchel, she unlocked the lifted car and slowly creaked open the door. Ara tried as gently as possible to lower herself the eight feet between the car and the floor. Ara managed to make only a slight tumble and a light thud. "Gonna miss that cozy hideout" She thought as she straightened her satchel on her back and brushed some dust off her. She began to pilfer from the cabinets of the old car garage. She found only dog food and old canned beans. "Jackpot" she whispered as she looked at the dog food. It had been a while since she'd found anything tasty. She opened a drawer on the workbench to find a flashlight. She clicked it on and off to see if the batteries were any good. She condensed the light in her hand to only allow a certain amount out so as not to alert the mumblers. She almost cried in delight to see a flashlight that worked after so many years. "Score!" Ara thought. She stashed the goods in her bag as she set about looking out the windows at the rainy surroundings. She spotted three mumblers holding their heads walking around on the gray wet pavement, they must have been attracted to the smell of an adolescent girl in the middle of the night. "Curse, being me." She said quietly. Her dad had taught her their movements and patterns after he had studied them for years, while also running with a screaming child. They reacted to heat, sound, and scent with keen interest. Light was hit or miss, the boils and scabs that covered their heads sometimes blocked their vision, turning a handful into echo-locating predators. Ara's father had warned her that growing girls in her age range would go through chemical changes and he had assumed that much like bears these mumblers had the same reaction to those smells. He'd been right. Ara pushed off the thoughts of some latent traumatic experiences, she scanned the surroundings of the old auto garage that she had raided the night before and she tried to hatch her escape plan. She knew she didn't want to be heading where the buildings got bigger and tighter, but she knew there were too many of these mumblers in the spread-out living spaces that had permeated the outskirts of cities from the before-time. Ara had hoped that the great chemical warfare that had occurred so long ago had saved a few more conscious bodies, like her and how her father used to be. Ara had thought that if her and her father had been able to survive that maybe someone else had been able to hold up somewhere around the city where there were heights and structures to sneak past or altogether avoid the changelings. Ara had spent weeks scaling the ruins of this city, finding no one. This garage had been a safe enough place to coop-up for the night, but she needed to migrate out of the city to avoid getting trapped by the ghoulish denizens of the city. She adjusted her beanie on her head as she tightened the straps on her backpack and equipped her kitchen knife. She looked out the garage window across the street to the apartments that rose above. Perhaps she'd find something useful in there, she thought. She could see a few shifting bodies walking close to the outside of the garage doors, so she instead went to check the far door that to lead inside the lobby of the car repair shop. Ara slowly opened the door and peered inside before she quickly ducked her head back inside as a mumbler looked in her direction. "Damn". Ara thought. "He might have seen me". She knew that it would be almost impossible to run through the streets and she had hoped she could sneak upstairs to a fire exit or something. She listened for a moment. Nothing. She slowly opened the door and eyed the ground-floor offices that lay across the lobby. It seemed the mumbler had moved on, likely following some pre-turned routine that had once been part of its previous existence. She leaned herself a little further out the door and looked to her left. Ara caught herself from making any sound. Pressed against the glass front of the building were an enumerable amount of mumblers blindly pressing against the left side of entrance and the two front doors. The sliding front doors creaked uneasily but held their ground. The mumbler Ara had seen earlier stood perplexed at the door. Ara paused for a moment to gather her surroundings. All of the mumblers outside must have had a sense of smell left and the one mumbler staring at them in wonder must have a growth in his nasal cavity or something. She thought for a moment and she decided to risk being seen by the large hoard as long as the single mumbler stayed put. Ara crept to the lobby desk and crouched next to the dismembered mumbler she had quietly dispatched last night. The former lobbyist had donated a stick of gum to Ara, after she had looted his pockets. She had used the cinnamon gum to curb her hunger before she tuckered out last night. Ara had felt fortunate to find both a place to eat and sleep last night, it had been a day since she had slept. She peeked around the desk to see if the situation remained the same. Still staring like a dope. Ara turned her attention to the stairs that lay behind the desk and to the right. They probably lead to some workplace above, where she could probably find a fire escape that went where there weren't hordes of mumblers. As she tiptoed up the stairs, she looked back on the scene; the one clogged mumbler perplexed by their brethren. If there wasn't a horrid dread of death by hungry mob, it might even be comical. Ara peeked through the glass door that lead to the second floor, it was much darker than the lobby. She swallowed a lump in her throat and then hurriedly unslung her bag to get her newly discovered flashlight ready. She knew it was a luxury that wouldn't last, but she had in the past had to stumble in the dark afraid, and Ara was not keen to relive that expereince. She softly clicked the door open and pulled the handle. "SQUEAAAK" The door rang to her displeasure. She looked down to see that her oblivious friend was, well, still oblivious. Ara quickly shuffled through the door and found herself in a dark office where only a few windows lit the scene. Ara quickly stowed into the first cubicle she found. If there were any mumblers they would head towards the door that just sang for lubricant and she needed a headcount of the mumblers. She stood on the desk as she heard movement. A lone grey figure walked down the corridor still holding some files from before in his hand. He seemed to be gabbering guttural noise as if he is discussing with himself some fiscal policy he was proposing. He walked towards the door and stopped at it. A single paper fell from his clutched file folder, which caught his attention. He neatly bent down, reached to grab the paper, and clumsily crunched the paper into a wad. Then the mumbler proceeded to jam the wad into the file folder. Ara watched with curiosity as this mumbler performed this seemingly innocuous ritual. "Was he supposed to crumple that paper?" She thought. He seemed not to know why he was attracted to the door and why carrying the paper, but just acted completely on a strange mix of both habit and instinct. He turned to his left and returned to his cacophony of burbling noises. She reached in her pocket and dripped some bile on her pant leg to make sure her scent was masked now that she was in close quarters. The mumbler stopped at a door, gazed at the wall to the left where a name was printed, before returning to his pace back further down the office. He quietly kept mumbling his droopy head as he kept walking, forever to hold his crumpled fiscal reports. Ara contemplating the figure, doomed to walk around with paper for no discernable reason. Ara caught herself: "Not now. Gotta keep moving." She thought. Ara crept down the hallway towards the watershed window as she looked for a way to cross over. There had to be a way she could scale to the other side. She flicked on her flashlight as she entered an office to find it's previous owner had been half-eaten. "Well, at least he's not moving." She said under her breath. She closed the door behind her, locked it, and went to the desk and began to rummage through it. She found a few supplies she would add to her survival gear before closing the desk drawer. As she did she looked at the portrait the man had placed on his desk of his family and children. "What a shame." She said. The corpse next to her made a scratchy guttural contraction. With a quick jump and stab she turned as the body struggled to lunge towards her. With a quick swipe of the kitchen knife, she decapitated the once-manager, letting his head roll to the ground. She had not been careful enough, she had to remind herself that even mumblers could be half eaten and still able to move. She recovered herself from the corner and listened for a moment to make sure no one else had heard. "Good." She thought. She went to the exec's window and looked across, there was a streetlamp just below her and the neon sign across from it. "Hmmm..." She thought. Maybe I can monkey bar my way across to the window. She slid the door open as she walked into the rain, she had no raincoat, so she knew she was going to be absolutely sopping wet by the time she reached the other side. She slowly perched on the window frame as she estimated how bad the fall would hurt her. She looked both ways down the street to see bands of previously human bodies huddling in their hunting parties. They weren't looking her way yet and she might have a small window before they see her. She pulled herself down the window till she was on her arms sticking her toe out to touch the streetlamp. "Closer.." She thought."closer.." As her hands slipped from the water of the edge she turned like a cat to try and break her fall. With a whump she hit the street lamp as she clambered on the best she could. She opened her eyes to see she had not fallen a story to break her leg or back, she had instead grabbed the street lamp and was now clinging with her life to it. One or two the heads from the hunting parties looked over to see a squirming figure in the distance. Slowly they started walking towards her. "Shoot." She thought. "This is exactly what I did not want." She squirmed across the wet pole closer to the lamp light as she started to slide forward. "Come on... Come on.." she thought. When she got to the light she was able to reposition herself to be sitting on top of the dangerously weak light. She could feel the entire structure below her bending uneasily and she put her right foot on top of the lamp as it began to capsize forward. "Here it goes!" she thought. She used her front foot to pounce her forward as she tried desperately to grab the neon sign in front of her. With a large crash the pole fixture she had jettisoned off of fell to the ground stirring the mumbler's hunting parties. With a resoundingly painful flump she was able to land her body onto the neon sign. Her chest felt on fire as she hit her ribs hard on the edge. "Oh that is going to bruise so bad." She thought. She scrambled to get on top of the window ledge above her as the neon sign too decided she was too heavy. "Oh come on!" She yelled as the neon sign too began to give out. Using what momentum she could to smash the window open with her flashlight she grabbed the inside ledge as her footing beneath her gave out. The group below swarmed the door of the building hoping she would fall into their crazy, hungry hands or mouths. Using as much muscle as she could muster, she dragged herself inside to find she was in a dark apartment. The groaning and cries outside became more muffled, forcing Ara to look into the near silent bleak dark den. She grasped her side and her flashlight hoping she had not bruised a rib or cut herself in the process. "There had better be something good in here." Ara thought. She grabbed the knife and put it over her flashlight hand much like she'd seen in illustration books she had read in her spare downtime. She thought she looked just like the heroes who always wore black or blue. As she searched the area, she found a secured living space with not a living soul to stop her from raiding the pantry. She greedily started to look in the bedroom for new clothes and she was happy to find a boys' black medium pullover hoodie which was perfect for the impending season's inclement weather. Since it was getting colder, the mumblers would hibernate most of the time in ground level buildings so Ara knew she was able to move around more in the day during the winter, that being said, it would be cold so Ara did not have any actual desire to do so. She took off her pants to try on this boy's skinny jeans to find that the two she had in mind were a little long, she decided she would settle for the darker pair because the white pair would tarnish anyways. As she dropped her drawers once again to change into the darker pants, she heard something shift behind her. In a panic she twisted around and grabbed her knife to find a tall and skinny teenage boy standing in the adjacent bathroom door in his pajamas. A toothbrush hung from his mouth as he stared at the Ara, now half naked, in his room. She rushed at him with the knife tripping on the pants around her ankles. "Fuck." She said as she landed in front of his feet. She looked up at him as he continued gaze in wonder. His face read: "This is not real." She quickly pushed herself to her feet. The boy moved to take the toothbrush from his mouth and Ara wheeled her arm around, clocking him upside the head with her knife handle and fist. He hit his head on the door jam and then fell down. Ara took a moment to catch her breath. She was breathing hard and trying to figure out what to do. She scanned the room while she continued to switch into the darker pair of pants. She tightened a belt around her waist and then she dragged the boy to a chair and tied him to it using clothes she found on the floor. After securing him to a chair, Ara knelt down next to him, placed her ear cautiously on his chest and listened for a heartbeat. "Please don't be dead." She said quietly. Bump bump bump bump. She exhaled in relief and stood up, her first contact with an intact human had not gone so smoothly. He had a curly mass of brown hair on his head that slightly obscured his eyes. He was pale, with brown eyes, and somewhat gangly arms. She continued to study him for a second, he had quite a few freckles that splashed across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. It looked as if he had only really stuck his face outside. She waited a minute and then decided it was probably best to waste no time gathering supplies in case she needed to bolt. She continued to rummage through his place, emptying drawers onto the otherwise clean floor and tossing things she didn't find useful over her shoulder. The boy had in a pot on a handmade range, used for cooking, with firewood still under it the center of the room. It looked like he'd been salvaging wood from one of the interior-facing walls. It looked as if he had holed up here for quite a while. She looked at the other bedroom across the way and she could hear movement. Brandishing her knife, she slowly turned the doorknob to the room and peered inside, finding a woman chained to the bed. The woman had brown hair much like the boy and revolting boils and scabs covering her eyes, unlike the boy. She screamed and hollered shaking the bed as Ara got closer. She spotted a picture on the adjacent wall of the boy and a pretty woman who Ara assumed the mumbler had once been. "Oh, you poor thing." The boy must have been too heartbroken and afraid to killer her, so he had decided to tie her up instead. Despite the woman's unintelligible protests, Ara decided to search the room. In the room she found assorted medications, condoms, and a lighter. "I'm sure these will come in handy." She thought as she tested the lighter. The whole time the mumbler yelled at her uttering all sorts of bizarre sounds she'd never heard. After her search she closed the door to give the mumbler some space, or really, so it would shut up. Lightening cracked in the distance outside as she continued her search of the house, pocketing everything valuable. After a while she figured she'd go check on the now surely disgruntled boy. As she entered the room she found him with his head leaned back giving a terrified look. For a second, they locked eyes, Ara realized she was holding her knife in a threatening way and so she set it down on the bookcase next to her. She slowly moved to the boy's bed and sat down. "Sorry" she said finally. "Was that..." he motioned with his head towards the bonds "...entirely necessary?" "I was surprised, and I didn't know what you'd do if you came to." Said Ara. "You were surprised?" He said raising both of his eyebrows and leaning his head forward. "So you knocked me unconscious and tied me up, because you were surprised?" He emphasized the last part of his sentence pointedly. "Very surprised" she said, looking off to the side. He gave an irritated scowl. She sat on his bed facing him. She grabbed one of his pillows and held it to her chest. It was so soft and in unbelievably good condition."You've got a nice place here." Ara said, breaking the silence. "Yeah, yeah I guess I do." He nodded his head a bit mockingly."Do you always do this to people you meet?" He said."Do what?" she said as she walked about the room rummage through his things. Ara picked up a pair of nail clippers out of the bathroom, impressed that there wasn't any rust."Go into people's homes and knock them out, then tie them to a chair?" The boy said in a raised voice."Not specifically." She said cutting her nails with his nail clippers. "You are the first person I have ever met." She added. He paused for a second and then abruptly asked:"Can I get out of these now?" He said, loosely struggling against the bonds. She narrowed her eyes at him. "How do I know I can trust you?" Ara said."My name's William." "That doesn't answer my question" She said sitting in front of him on the floor, just out of reach. "I'm trying to introduce myself." He said sighing. "I'm Ara." She said. "Nice to meet you now Ara, could you please untie me?" "I don't know if I can trust you." She said giving him an honest shrug. "Look, I promise I won't do anything, plus you broke into my house... so in all reality I shouldn't trust YOU." She shrugged again. "I mean, I guess you're right."  She walked behind him and untied the cloth restraints. Ara then speedily walked over to where she had set the knife, in case he had any funny ideas. He leaned forward in the chair slowly, visibly working to not make any sudden moves. She watched as he stood up and stretched his arms and back. He didn't seem to be that in shape, in fact, it seemed as if he'd been inside a while. His frame was not well developed, and she noted about the only thing going for him was his face and his teeth. "Mental note: steal his toothpaste." She thought, stealing a glance towards the bathroom. "How long have you lived here?" Ara asked as he finished his overly dramatic stretches. He paused and thought of a clever answer:"My whole life", he said as he walked over to his bed and had a seat. "Have you ever left?" Ara said."Good gracious no." He said with a pale white expression. Before Ara could ask what "gracious" was, he continued: "The last time dad went out to gather food he..." He looked down forlornly. "...he never came back..." Ara looked down at the ground with a sullen expression: "That's how my dad went too." William looked up from his bed at the young woman who had just Goldilocksed his place. "Then we two are alike I guess." He said with a nervous chuckle. She looked up and made a weak smile: "Yeah, I guess we are." There was a moment of silence that seemed both awkward, yet understanding. "You.." began Will. "...You are welcome to stay as long as you like." He said. "Thanks." She said. Ara didn't know if she could really trust him, but she was confident she could take him if things went south and it was already getting close to night; the rain had picked up in intensity. She contemplated it for a moment and decided it was far better to be in a dry place right now. She smiled after a moment."I was going to stay anyways, regardless." She chuckled. He just slowly nodded his head and gave a small smile. "I figured as much."       That evening they gathered some of the broken furniture, as Will had been doing for years, and put it in the range that had been made from a fashioned years ago from a camp stove from nearby park. As the lightning and thunder rolled in the crowded crazed denizens began to move towards buildings and huddle against the walls or under coverings and open passageways. The two youngsters sat on the couch opposite of each other as Will stirred the pot filled with old beans. He looked over at Ara every once and a while to check if there really was still a strange girl in his apartment. The wind raged through the blanket he had nailed over the broken window. It would be cold this evening and now the only two contained rooms contained a chained moaner and an undersized twin bed. "I'm not sleeping in the same bed as you." Ara said abruptly, sensing Will's unease. The erupted silence caused Will's heart to spike and his face to become flush. "What made you think I would ask?" he said containing the lump in his throat. "Oh, nothing... I was just trying to..." She backed herself further into a mental corner, realizing she was being overly presumptuous and revealing her thoughts. "I... I-I just thought I would clarify that I wanted to sleep in a different room." Will kept a small smile to try and disperse the tension. She shook her head, trying to changing the subject she said: "Is that your mother in there?" Will looked back down at the wavering fire. "Yeah...  yeah it is." Ara crossed her legs as she started to shiver. Will walked to his room and grabbed a small blanket tossing it to Ara. "Two years, three months, and nineteen days." He said looking at the door. Ara held a coffee mug filled with heated water. A moment passed with only the wind howling and the two shivering. "I'm sorry William..." She said after a while. "... About your mum." She looked out the un-shattered window at the gray night sky, she chuckled a tiny bit grabbing Will's attention. "And also the window, sorry about that." She glanced at him as he raised his head with a small grin. "It's fine. I could never get that one open anyways and I wanted a breeze." He said. "Not right now, you don't." Ara said laughing, pulling the covers around her tighter. Will exhaled a breath of air so that he could see it. "Yeah, I guess now isn't the season for a window." As the night waned on Ara and Will silently held each other's company delighting in another person's presence. Ara had been delighted to find that Will was funny and seemed to know a lot. Will sat nursing his head, he walked to the bathroom and produced a bottle with tablets inside. "It's for the swelling." He said as he put two tablets in his mouth. "How does that work?" Said Ara. "What? You've never used Ibuprofen?" Said Will, surprised. "What's Ibuprofen?" "It's this stuff." He said shaking the bottle. "It reduces swelling and relives pain." "Really? I've just been eating those." Said Ara. Will's eyes widened. "You've been eating these?" He said with a tone that Ara couldn't quite place. Was he judging her?"Well yeah." Ara said looking at Will confused. "It's food.""It's medicine! Eating more than two of these can cause..." He looked at the back of the bottle and tried reading the label in the fire light, which proved difficult to do. "It causes internal damage. It's bad for you." He stated finally. "Oh, I didn't know." Said Ara. Will still gave a worried expression: "You need to be careful with medicine, if you don't read the back of the bottle you could kill yourself." Ara shrugged: "I can't really read." Will tried to retract his worried expression, realizing he was unfairly judging Ara. "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't..""It's okay. My father had meant to teach me to read, but we..." She paused. "I guess we didn't really have that much time to read." Ara glanced about the room, noticing the intact and sorted collection of books that remained untouched. It occurred to her that Will had opted to destroy part of his shelter instead of burning the books to remain warm. Ara yawned as Will was getting up. He went into his room and came out with a blanket and a pillow. "Feel free to take my bed, it shouldn't be as cold as out here, I'll take this couch." Ara was put off by the suggestion. "I'm fully capable of taking care of myself." She said sternly. Will stopped and thought for a second. "I can see that, but I'm offering you a chance to sleep in a real bed. If you don't want to take it...""No no no, I'll take the bed." She said, changing her tune and picking herself up. Will shook his head and plopped himself on the couch, pointing his head towards the window. As Ara got to the door, she looked back and asked. "What do you think caused the end?" she said after a moment. Will took a moment to gather his thoughts on the abrupt question. "What end?" said Will finally. "Well, the end of the world." She said. "My father said a long time ago that the world fell apart and... well ended." Will looked around the room and then back to Ara. "I mean, I don't know if it really ended. I mean, we're here. I think it just... changed." He stared back at her.       Ara thought about it for a second and walked off silently. Will laid his head on his pillow and curled up in his blanket, thinking about his answer. She closed the door behind her as she crawled into his bed. She lay for a moment considering his answer. "Just changed." She said, marinating the thought in her head. She rolled around on the bed, trying to secure the edges under her to make a sort of cocoon. She hadn't had the habit, nor really the luxury, of sleeping in beds because they were not usually secure enough for her comfort. It wasn't as rigid as she was used to but for once, it felt almost... safe. She thought about how nice it would be to just curl up in this blanket and sleep forever, escape the world and it's troubles. She wrapped her arms around herself to trap as much heat as she could. Though her dad's sleeping bag lay on top, she felt warmest knowing she was in another real person's blanket. Ara couldn't help but be obsessed with the thought that it wasn't her alone in the world. That someone else really was alive. As she pressed her head against the pillow, she could smell him. It was so foreign to smell another person, there seemed to be something else, something musky, but also sweet. Did he bath regularly? She thought about the luxury of a bath with water that had scents in it. She drifted asleep to the smell of shampoo.      Will wrapped himself as best as he could, cramping his feet up so he could fit on the horrid couch. He was uncomfortable, but he knew it was the right thing to, for a guest. He'd watch his father treat his mother as if she was a guest, what he'd jokingly called "chivalry". He imagined the girl in the other room, replaying their strange encounter. It was like nothing he'd ever read about; she was more complexed than any Jo March or Lizzie Bennett. He raised his hand to that side of his head as it was still bruised. He could see his breath as he turned his head examining the room, she had definitely trashed the place. The fire lay low as the charcoals were slowly dying, Will drifted to sleep in the chill living room. Chapter 2: RoommatePopcorn. Fluffy white popcorn. Or is it snow? White uneven snow that sprinkles the top of my ceiling. Cottage cheese? Why did they ever put that stuff on ceilings? Will thought. Who ate cottage cheese? Just pictures of that stuff looked nauseating. Will sat on his couch for the first few seconds reminiscing his favorite morning subject. He felt tired. Exhausted. He felt this stirring in his chest. He felt... different, happier. He could see the dark light of the late fall sky on the ceiling stretching, he followed it down the wall until his eyes rested on open kitchen cabinets. Was I robbed? "Oh, right." Will thought. He glanced towards the door, which was still shut. He picked himself off the couch, stretching his now sore back. He wrapped the blanket tighter around himself and gently touched his head. "Maybe I fell on my head yesterday and imagined all that Ara stuff." Will moved across the room to the door and opened it slowly to double check his sanity. On his bed, there she lay, bundled up in a cocoon of blankets. "Okay, didn't imagine that. Still sane." He thought. He caught himself staring and decided to close the door and get the fire started again. As he closed the door, Ara opened one uneasy eye from under the blankets. Will set about starting a fire in his normal way, breaking pieces of a chair that as of recently had been set in the dining table. He'd managed to unscrew all of the joints and he'd used his father's old tools to saw the chair into manageable chunks. He opened his parent's bedroom, his mother screamed at him. "Good morning mom, did you have restful sleep?" She continued to flounder and scream. Will rummaged through the bedside table looking for the lighter he stashed there. "Huh, I guess I misplaced it." As he turned around his heart jumped as he noticed Ara in the door wielding her knife looking around with wild eyes.  "Are you okay?" She said glancing at the aggravated and screaming mumbler. Will looked at her confused and then back to his mother. "Oh. Yeah, I'm okay." He stopped and then jokingly gestured from the mumbler to Ara: "Mom meet Ara, Ara meet mom." His mother just continued to howl and Ara stood still in the doorway with a confused expression. Will waved his hand down towards the ground: "Alright, that one didn't land. It's alright, mom never laughs at my jokes either." Will walked away from the bedside table and towards Ara. "Have you seen bic somewhere around here?" Ara backed away from the door, knife still drawn. "What's bic?" She said. "It's a brand." Will replied as he walked back into the living room. "Would you mind closing the door?" He said behind him. Ara shut the door, giving an uneasy glance towards the mumbler. "What's a brand?" Ara said as Will looked under the sofa cushions. "Uh..." Will thought about this for a moment, he was now coming to terms with how limited Ara's vocabulary might be, reminding himself that she didn't have the same upbringing he'd had. Will said: "I guess you could say it's a type of lighter from the before times. There used to be several types, that were called 'brands'." He looked at Ara, who was still facing his mother's door. Ara turned to face him "Why do you keep her?" She said. "She's the only family I have left." Will said as he sat down on the floor."Will, she's gone." Ara said blankly. "That is not your mother. That mumbler is dangerous to keep around." Will gave a perplexed expression. "That is my mother. Even if she is a zombie." Ara returned a perplexed expression. "What's a zombie?" She said as she walked into the kitchen to forage breakfast. Will watched as Ara continued to add clutter to the kitchen floor. "A zombie is what you call a 'mumbler', I think." Wills said. "Will you stop that?" He said, showing his visible irritation. "Stop what?" Ara said, pausing. "You are continuing to destroy my house." He said. Ara looked around her in a confused state. Will looked at her in disbelief. "Do you even know what personal property means?" Will asked. Ara shook her head. Will closed his eyes and held the bridge of his nose for a second. "Okay, Ara, would you give me your knife?" He said. Ara clutched her knife close to her chest. "Absolutely not." She said, giving Will an defensive glare. Will extended an arm while looking to the side. "And why will you not let me have your knife?" "Because I need it." Ara stated blankly. "And?" Will said. Ara looked around for a second and then returned her irritated gaze to Will. "It's mine." Will pointed with his finger at Ara and said. "Exactly. It's your possession. Your personal property." Ara gave him a blank stare. Will circled both hands around him, gesturing to the whole apartment. "This whole house is my personal property. And you keep throwing all of my stuff on the floor." Will said. Ara's expression was a deer caught in the headlights. She glanced at all of the clutter on the table in front of her. "Lemme ask you a question." Will continued. "When you raid or scavenge, or whatever you want to call it, have you ever noticed how neatly everything is arranged? Like there is some sort of reason that those objects are there like that." Ara thought about it for a second. She was not understanding, nor did she appreciate, the tone or direction of this apparent confrontation, but stopping to think about it, there was always some sort of order to things she found, which was sort of hard to place. "I guess so." She said after a short minute. "But what about it?"Will took a deep breath. "What I am trying to say is that I have taken a lot of time to sort and store all of the stuff you have strewn... I mean thrown about this house and I do not like it." Will said calmly. Ara looked around her, she didn't quite get it, but she knew she'd done something wrong in his eyes. They sat there silently for a few minutes, Will got a shiver that reminded him that he was trying to get a fire started. He quietly said: "Have you seen a blue lighter?" Ara shook herself from her thoughts. "You mean this one?" She said as she produced a lighter from her pocket. Will sat with his mouth open, then he caught himself, took a deep breath and said: "Yeah, that one."      After getting the fire started he went about making himself breakfast from the stores of expired shelf-stable food his parents had left him. Ara sat by the fire scarfing down a can of something brown. "What are you having?" Will said, trying to lighten the mood. Through ravenous muffled bites Ara said: "My father called it 'dogfood', it's pretty great." Will stopped preparing his food and said: "Excuse me." And walked out of the room. Ara watched him curiously as he left. Then she heard Will in the next room make muffled gagging noises. She looked at the door with concern. "Are you alright?" She shouted.In the distance she heard a muffled. "I'm fine."Will returned after a little while and proceeded to scoop a cup into a bucket of water that was sitting near the sink. He wiped his hand across his brow and asked if Ara was done eating so Will could eat without losing his appetite again. Ara looked at him a little cross. "You seem to not like the things that I do." She said pointedly. Sensing some animosity, he put his hands up defensively. "No no, it's not that, it's just..." He chewed on his next words. "You do things... differently and I am... adjusting." Ara didn't seem pleased with his answer, but she decided to let it rest while she packed her bag. Will brought a plate of stale crackers and a can of something that he place by the edge of the fire. "Leaving already?" he joked. Ara looked at him quizzically. "Well yeah, gotta keep moving." Will blinked, he hadn't expected that she was seriously packing her bag to leave. "But... but you just got here, where are you even going?" Will asked. "I'm heading North, away from all the mumblers." Said Ara in a matter-of-fact tone."Well why?" stammered Will. "Because my father said that it'd be safer to the North." "How do you know that?" Said Will. Ara thought about it for a second."I guess I don't know that, but I know it's safer than being in one place. And I know now that this city isn't safe." Will picked up the now hot can and tried to balance it on his leg. "What makes you think that, it's pretty safe here." He said pointing around the house."Not really." Replied Ara as she zipped up her satchel. "There are a ton of mumblers in the city and there's not a lot of food, even in here." Will looked around his apartment, it was true that he'd been living off of the food his parents had been able to scavenge, the only reason he hadn't needed to scavenge yet was because he was the only one in his family left. He'd been harvesting rainwater for some time and it was only a matter of time before the toiletries stopped working as the nearby water tower would eventually be depleted of it's precious water and pressure. Hell, it'd been a miracle that he had been able to experience toiletries, given the world's condition. He'd even seen electricity in use when his father had found a generator and made it run for some time. Ara was kind of right, there wasn't a lot left here in terms of supplies and Will was certainly going to have to face the harsh realities of survival sometime soon. "Let's for the moment..." Will started to say. Ara leaned back in her sitting position and propped herself against the wall. "...let's say that what you say is true and it is indeed safer outside of the city. How would you survive outside of the city?""Well I hunted deer and deerbill before I came to the city and found edible plants occasionally." Said Ara. Will dipped a stale cracker in the can, scooping a white chunky mixture out. "What's a deerbill?" He said with a confused expression. Ara tried to explain: "It's a long-legged, hairy animal with spikes on its back. It smells pretty bad but tastes a lot like fowl." "It smells bad and tastes foul?" Will said. "Why even eat it?""No, it tastes like fowl, you know the flying things." Said Ara making a flapping motion. Will said: "Oh, you're talking about birds. Wait, you've seen a bird?" Ara shrugged. "I guess? I'm not really sure what a bird is." Will set his can on the ground and walked over to the bookshelf where he retrieved an avion filed guide and showed Ara a picture. "Oh, yeah, I guess it sort of looked like that." "You are telling me that you ate a vulture?" Will said with his eyes wide open. "Something like that, though it's stomach was a lot bigger and it's mouth had sorta spiky teeth." Replied Ara. Will shut the book and returned to his can of food. He contemplated what horrors Ara had witnessed and hunted. "Would you..." Ara started. "Would you come with me?" She said sheepishly. Will coughed a bit and stared at the ground. Ara looked away and moved to get up. "Wait." Will said. "Uh, maybe, I need time to think about it."Ara smiled, "How long do you need? An hour?" "No no no, like, I need a few days. I am not exactly prepared to decide to abandon the life I have lived all my life to tough it out in the country with someone who broke into my house yesterday."Ara looked disappointed but she wanted the chance to not be alone all of the time. Will stared into the fire for a few minutes. Ara paced around the house, as she passed the bathroom she saw a large white bowl that she could fit into. "Will?" She said. "Yeah?" he said. "Could I... Take a bath?" She said. Her cheeks gained a bit of a rosy tint. Will was surprised to see how embarrassed she was at the request. "Yeah sure, all you need to do is turn the handle to get some cold water and we can heat a few buckets of water to make it hot." Ara's eyes widened. Hot water? Will stood in his bedroom looking out his window at the city skyline. Distant moans could be heard from his neighbors, what was left of them anyways. He sat contemplating the decision laid out before him. Did he even stand a chance of surviving? Even with Ara, who had lived in the outside world below for so long. He looked down at the auto-company across the street, the light pole lay obstructing the street. Will chuckled to himself as he replayed Ara's story of the single zombie staring through the pane glass. He heard giggling and splashing behind him. There was no doubt that Ara was experiencing the luxury of a hot bath for the first time. He turned around to see a faint glow coming from the bathroom. He normally left the door open so he could see while he took a bath, but out of privacy he had given Ara a candle instead. As Will stared at the door he saw bubbles and water ooze out from under the door. Ara called Will's name. "What is it?" Will said a little startled. "How do I make it not hot? It's too hot in here!"Will sighed, Ara probably dumped all of the soap or shampoo in the tub and created a layer of bubbles that made it too hot. Classic mistake.Will approached the door. "Just open the door or step out of the tub for a minute or two to cool down." He said. He heard a huge splash as Ara jettisoned from the tub. Will swung around towards the door and went to exit the room. The bathroom door flung open and Will shut the door with a bang behind him. He heard Ara sing a sigh of relief as she exclaimed about how hot it had been in there. Will was sweating a bit thinking about how fast she had willing to open that door, he reminded himself that she definitely had a different way of doing things and that privacy might be a somewhat nuanced concept. Will approached the living room window to spy on his "mumbling" neighbors while he thought hard about what it would take to really leave the city. A big splash brought him back to the apartment, Ara had jumped back in and was declaring her love of hot baths. Will chuckled, she was definitely a strange roommate. 	Will and Ara continued to cohabitate over the next few days. Ara tried understanding Will's sometimes baffling customs and Will noticed Ara's efforts to do so. Will inventoried what food he had and tried his best to try to think of things in terms of risk and reward. He was scared of the risk he was taking, but as he and Ara spent more time together, he realized he might not have a chance to survive without another person, especially someone like Ara who had survived on the outside for so long. A few nights after their first meeting, Will watched as snow drifted down on the rooftops of the adjoining buildings. Ara was studying a picture book trying to discern the words using some of the pointers that Will had tried to give her. Will turned and stated. "Okay." Ara looked up. "Okay what?""Okay, I'll go with you. We should leave tomorrow morning." Ara jolted herself up. "Tomorrow morning? Why tomorrow?""The mumblers won't be active tomorrow because of the snow." Said Will pointing outside. "We can probably sneak out of town without being chased if we leave tomorrow morning." "Alright." Said Ara, she went about the house rummaging through the pantry gathering as many materials as possible. Will watched the destructive mayhem reawakened in Ara, who had patiently asked about disturbing anything in his house after his previous tirade. Will turned to the bookcase on his left and looked at a photograph of his family. He father and mom stood holding his shoulder as his younger self beamed back at him. "I hope this is the right decision." He said quietly.       He had never in his natural life been down the steps of his complex and he dreaded seeing another creature like his mom. Ara had waited patiently as Will had knelt by his mother's bed and said his goodbye. She was crying hysterically. Will tried to imagine it was because he was leaving and not because she was a crazy creature who had lost its mind. Ara saw how emotional this had been for Will. She knew this is why he hadn't put her to rest, he didn't have the heart to do so. Ara did, she definitely could, but she decided that she probably shouldn't. Ara looked at the floorboards, it seemed so selfish to think she could just make that decision for Will. Will cried next to his mother's bed while putting on his winter coat and backpack. She grabbed Will's hand as he locked the room behind him. "Hey, this is for the best." She said.Will looked at her and wiped a tear from his cheek. "I know, it's just hard to finally say goodbye. She doesn't even know I'm leaving." Ara patted him on the back walked with him to the boarded front door. She picked up a hammer she'd borrowed from Will's father and pried the boards off. Will slowly turned the door as Ara held the flashlight and her knife ready. Will thought about how brave Ara looked. She had him cut her curly black hair short so she wouldn't have to put her hair back. Despite its shortness it tried to curl out behind her ears. She looked ahead with vigilance and without fear. When she opened the door she only stared into the dark void with no hesitation. Though she was shorter than Will she was by many means tougher, she gripped the handle of her knife and flashlight with the grip of a warrior. Her bright blue eyes contrasted her half-black ancestry, she seemed so different from any woman he'd ever seen in pictures or film covers, she was by far nothing like the fictional women he'd read. She really was unique, and Will thought, quite beautiful.  A warrior contained in her, an unbreakable force held with indominable grace. Chapter 3: A Brave New World"You comin' or are you just going to stare at me?" Ara said as she looked back at Will. Will had spaced out and was now hurrying down the hall. "Sorry, I was... nevermind." He said smiling as he caught up to her. He held a crowbar poised as he followed her down the concrete stairs. As they hit the ground level Ara signaled for Will to stop with a press on his chest as she slid forward turning off the flashlight. "What are you doing?" he said loudly. Ara whisked around and placed her hand on his mouth. A groaning movement could be heard to the side of her. She held wide eyes indicating if he was going to follow her, he had better shut up. He pursed his lips with wide eyes. "My bad" he whispered. Ara placed her foot on the floor as quietly as she could while skirting the wall to look through the glass door. She peered through to see a mumbler or two walking in the main lobby of the apartment complex. One had his ears perked and was actively sniffing. They had to move fast. She indicated for Will to go to the glass door leading outside. He moved less stealthily to the door peering to the glass. As he did so Ara came up behind him and looked as well. The road was clear for the moment, too snowy for the likes of mumblers. She nodded her head forward to proceed and as Will opened the door a bell rang in the lobby; apparently still hardwired to alert that a customer or tenant had walked in. With a shove Ara pushed Will through the door and grabbed his hand as she began to run down the snowing street. Will had never had the explicit opportunity to run and was being dragged by an experience runner resulting in a face full of snow as he plopped in the middle of the street. Ara, wide-eyed grabbed his backpack strap and seemed to pick him up as she forced him up. If a mumbler was brave it could run out and get them. As they ran out of the small-town Ara looked back to see if they were being followed. Nothing. When they reached the hill looking over the city she let Will rest and studied the direction they came and where they were now blindly moving. Will sat panting a moment as he struggled to get out: "Where... pant... are... pant  we... pant... heading?" She turned to his shivering, exacerbated form. Where were they running? She shrugged. Will looked at her in complete disbelief. "You mean we just risked our lives for... for nothing?" He looked back at his town and then back to her. She shrugged again. He approached her and placed his arms in his armpits for warmth. "O-oh... Okay." He said. He realized that there really wasn't anywhere to go, but the promise of somewhere safer was all they could hope for. A desperate move for sure. But food wasn't excessively abundant, and neither was sanity. So forward they must progress. They walked down the road towards what used to be a highway traveling East. "I came from the West." Said Ara. "There's nothing safe there." she wanted to explain her reasoning from "rescuing" her prince from his tower, there really wasn't any. "My.. my father.." she said as the two walked with their hands in their pockets. "... had always been running North and this direction and he'd always told me to keep running and to never look back." "Why?" Asked Will. "Not a clue." She said looking towards the ground then to her partner.  The two walked in tandem as if on their way to school in the snow. Had the world been different, only an innocent and charming scene it would be. Around them only desolate waste could be seen. Ruined cities in the distance. Broken cars by their side.  Only the two brave figures disturbed the silence. "I guess maybe your dad was running from something?" offered Will after a moment of silence. "I guess." She said. She had always felt as if her father's shadow had been behind her all along haunting her. "I just know not to stay in one place. He was always on the run with my mother, he spoke of her often." "Did you know her?" "No." Ara said with a sad tone. "She died when I was born." "I'm sorry to hear that." He said placing his hand on her shoulder. "It's okay." She said. "He would always tell me she wasn't made for this world; it had happened after she had died." "It?" Asked Will. "This." She said twisting about pointing to the dead world. Will examined his desolate surroundings. A much more daunting reality to be in the midst of, more than he'd ever seen from his apartment. "Ah, that." He said softly. The dead trees became more apparent and the live ones became a distant memory as they slowly walked down the road. "What do you think caused it?" said William after a long frigid spell. "Love." Said Ara. Will stopped. "What?" Ara stopped and faced him while walking backwards. "Dad said that the world was ended by a single man's love. In his jealousy and his rage he had decided to blow up the entire world." Will held the straps of his backpack as he walked with her. "How can one man be so selfish?" he said. "My dad said that the man lost his daughter and shortly after his wife left him. Causing him to go into a genocidal rampage." "How could one man have all that power?" said Will, becoming more fascinated with this scenario. "I don't know." Ara said, Will made a face that exclaimed his disbelief. "How did your dad know?" said William looking at Ara incredulously. Ara knew she Will had caught on to her fiction: "Alright, I don't really know, I was just making up a story." Said Ara with a smile. "I'm impressed, you definitely had me at the beginning." Ara exchanged a devious look with Will, she'd definitely picked up some narrative flourishes from Will's recounting of famous stories. Ara and Will passed a cliff spotting a lump in the snow. "Wanna check it out?" said Will. "Sure. But we need to be careful." Ara grabbed his arm as he lost his balance. "With you, I think we can stand up to anything." He said jokingly. "If there's a Will, there's a way." Ara chuckled at his joke, but in truth she didn't quite get it. They walked down the steep pass towards the lump sticking out in the snow. She raised her eyebrows as they approached the object. "Watch out!" Ara said as Will slipped and hit the object with his side shattering the glass with his elbow. "Will!" she cried as she got him up. "Are you hurt?" He wheezed a bit and said:  "Yeah.. I'm fine." As Ara pulled him up he got a glance over Ara's shoulder, Will's eyes bolted wide.  "Ara." Will said as he spotted something run off in the distance. "What?" she said brandishing her knife from her belt. "Something is following us." He said looking at the hill where he'd seen the large white figure. "What did it look like?" She said. "I don't know... kinda looked like a big... " " A big what?" she said darting her eyes about in the bright snow.  "I'm being serious, so don't laugh, but I think I just saw a Yeti." "A what?" Her father hadn't told her what a yeti was. "A Yeti?" she said. "What's a Yeti?" He tried to think of a good answer. "It's a big snow monster from fairytales, like a man-bear thing that's white." He said scanning the place he thought he'd seen it. His heart pounded noticeably. "Out here?" She went back-to-back with Will as he limply held his crowbar. "I wonder if it saw us." "I think it definitely saw us." Ara tried to think fast. "Shit, we should have been more careful." She said. The day had been mostly wasted by their slow walk in the snow and who knew how long this "Yeti" had been following them. She looked around to find cover but only could see a lone tree and a green sign in the distance, they would have no way of finding shelter for the night unless they got to the sign and read it. Will looked back at what he'd elbowed only moments prior. It was an upside-down car that had fallen from the cliff above. It sat with its left side exposed. Will began uncovering the window so that he could see inside. In the driver seat sat a dead corpse with only sinewy remains. "We could stay here for the night." He offered trying to evaluate the situation as his partner was. Ara looked at the vehicle, it was buried enough it might throw off the monster's scent. "Get it open." She said as she turned back towards where the Yeti had been spotted. "Fast." She added. She stared towards the hill that followed the road they had just been on. Will stuck his arm into the broken glass of the car's backside window while Ara scanned for any signs that the monster might find their hideaway. Ara looked towards the cliff to see in the middle of the white a set of four round teary eyes looking at her. It had scampered above them on the cliff to get a good look at them. "Will." She said as he tried to reach the lock. "I can't reach the lock." Said Will struggling. "Will!" she yelled as the eyes disappeared as it ran down the road to confront them. Will pulled his arm out and tried the door. "The damn door was unlocked. Quick, get in." said Will opening the door. Will jumped in as Ara got to the door, she scampered inside and shut the door. With some luck the door had snow above it that fell covering the side they had just entered. With a sigh of relief, they both leaned back in the car on the smashed top as they heard the creature approach. Will's eyes widened as he realized the door was unlocked. "Do you think this thing is intelligent enough to open doors?" he whispered as he leaned forward towards the door lock. The beast stood outside the door of the embedded car studying it. It put its unseen claws on the doors slowly scraping the surface. Will tried hard not to make a sound as he reached his hand towards the door above and pressed the lock making a regrettably loud "click". The creature heard the click and began to rail up against the car trying to break it open. As the car shook violently on the only exposed side Will fell back into Ara. He adjusted himself and lunged for the front door to lock it. As the second "click" was heard the creature became enraged that it's lunchbox was now un-openable. It skirted its big face across the surface pressing it to the glass. Ara and Will got a good look at the monster as it tried to see through the car's tinting at its next meal. It had four eyes arranged in cross that were perfect unblinking circles. It probably couldn't blink because it had tear streaks that went down its lightly furred face. It had it's spiky mouth open with a three-pronged tongue licking the glass. It was hungry. It wiggled its tongue inside of the broken mini-window at the back right side. Ara and Will backed as far as they could into the sunken car as it bashed at the bottom of the car. Will and Ara held on tight as the monster then attempted to lift the car. It began roaring as it flipped the car onto its side charging the side flipping it over unto it's wheels. The monster breathed heavily as it scampered on top of the car, it tried in a rather defeated way to claw the car finding only to its great annoyance a terrible scratching sound. It roared and grabbed the side of its head as it jumped off. Will and Ara sat in the backseat holding on for dear life. "Wait, I think it doesn't like loud noises!" Will said as he leaned forward towards the driver's side corpse. Though the interior had grown decrepit he could make out the horn symbol of the car horn as he hit it with her palm. With an anti-climactic click no sound was produced. Will blinked and then thought about it. "Right, yeah, the battery." The creature slowly backed off as it grew irritated at it's lack of progress. They heard it bellow a mournful wail from the cliff above. Will leaned back into the backseat and put his head in his hands. "Why did I leave home?" He said with tears in his eyes. Ara scooted next to him and leaned over him to see out the other window. She peered outside for any sign of a second attack. She leaned back and looked at Will who was breathing hard and freaking out. Knowing Will was not exactly prepared for this new terrifying life she had introduced him to, she tired to console him by saying: "It's okay. We're alive." "No... no, it's not okay." Said Will looking at Ara. "You came in like a whirlwind ruining my life, now its day one and something wants to eat me. I'm miles away from home" Distract Will from freaking out and excite her as she knew this was incredibly risky. But she knew there was a layer of car between their hungry and very upset pursuer. She found his wallet and found a ring on his hand, She grabbed the ring and looked in the passenger side finding a finger with another ring lay also on the car floor. "Weird, this guy's lover had her finger removed. She's not even in the car. " She looked around and William just shrugged his shoulder. The car seemed to have been undisturbed for some time. "What I don't get is how the car is intact if it fell from the cliff. Like why aren't the windows busted?" Ara returned to his lap and snuggled back under the blanket as she pilfered through the man's wallet. "Huh, it's waterlogged." She said holding a blurred picture of a family. "That explains it!" said Will making a conclusion. "Hmm?" This guy fell off the cliff and landed in a river." Ara nodded booping him on the nose. "You're so smart." She peered at his pictures of an old man with his wife and two children who held hands. One boy, one girl. She guessed the owner of the wallet had been the boy when the picture was taken. He was about their age, maybe older while the girl seemed about a few years younger. They seemed happy. Will rested his head against the back as Ara studied the photos and his license, she could only make out the name "Jeremy" from his license. "Hmm... his name was Jeremy." "Will looked at the faded picture. "Handsome fellow." He said turning his head towards Ara. "I know I would have slept with him first if I'd met him." "Ahh.. I'm hurt. You know he can hear you right?" he laughed. "I might just got sit on him if you're not careful." "I take it back, I wouldn't want to lose you to a corpse." "Eh, he was married." She said slipping the woman's ring onto her finger. "Hmm..." she said. "What?" said Will coming out from his half-sleep. "It fit's perfectly on my hand." Will looked curiously at the modest wedding ring on her hand. "I don't think his fits on me Cinderella. Looks like you're his bride." "Cinda-what?" she said looking at him confused. "Never mind, you don't know the reference." He said adding another mental note to the ever-going mental journal. "Whatever, I think I'll keep this as a promise to his missing bride." "A promise?" said Will. "Yeah, you know, the promise his bride must have made to win his affection." "And what is that?" "That I will love you, in sickness and in health, till death do us part." She said looking up at him. "Whoa whoa whoa.." Will said jokingly. "I didn't ask for no commitments." "Well, like it or not they found you." She said kissing him on the cheek. "Alright, you can stay... you can stay..."  Felt, tan felt. Why did they ever put this stuff in vehicles? Is it even felt? Cashmere maybe? Nobody likes it. William ran his hand on the ceiling to feel the irritating asbestosy touch that came with the interior ceiling of vehicles from the time before them. Ara disturbed as he moved in the cold seats. She watched him as he did his spaced out thinking. He might have a bit of an attention problem she thought. "Do you do that a lot?" Will snapped out of his trance. "Do what?" "Oh you know..." she said turning to look up at him. "Do you like to analyze and... think about stuff a lot?" "Yeah, I do." My mom used to call it "A-D-D" or something like that. Never knew what she meant by it. Why do you ask?" "Oh I was just curious, you seem to go puzzle about things a lot." "There's a lot to think about", he said as he pulled the blanket off. "Is there?" she said in a sarcastic tone. "Well no one else is thinking so I have to do all the thinking for the world. The most valuable resource used to be just leisure time. Time for thinking." Ara looked out the window. "You'd be surprise what thinks and what doesn't. And yet, there's no leisure time out there." Will tried to contain his face of horror as he realized why they were in the car in the first place. "You think it ran off?" "What? No... most likely stalking the area waiting till we are hungry or something." Ara said as she opened a can of dog food." "Are you seriously going to eat that?" She looked at him with unwavering disconcern. "Well yeah, thing has more nutrients than anything your going to find. They injected all sorts of proteins and vitamins in this for dogs back in the day." Will gave a blank stare. "I guess my dad had a bit more medical background then your parents. He taught me all sorts of stuff." Will shrugged. "Yeah... my dad was an accountant and my mom was a realtor." "Ah" said Ara nodding. She peered out of the window trying to see if the Yeti had made any big moves. All she could see was the tree and in the distance the green sign that marked what city was next. She studied the tree a minute. "Oh look a tire swing." Said Will pressing up next to her as he packed the blankets. "I don't remember there being a tire swing." Will added. Ara looked as hard as she could, but with all the snow and glare she could not figure out what it was, she assumed it was a trap. "I think its bait Will. It knows we were headed in that direction. " Will tried to stare at it and discern but he came only with a blank, "So what's the game plan?" "Well, since it's early enough in the day maybe it is still resting, we can try and sneak past it and hope the next town is not too far away." She grabbed her knife as she slung her backpack on and will picked up his crowbar from the ground. "Are you ready?" she said quietly. Will said: "Wait." She tried to ask "what?" but was only interrupted by a good luck kiss. "Okay, now I'm ready." Said Will as he lifted the lock on the car door. Ara paused before she clicked the door open. Slowly they opened the door trying not to make a single creak. With vague success they snuck out of the car and crossed to the other side of the road into the drainage ditch hoping to gain some coverage. It took them a half hour to make any sizeable distance to be parallel with the tree. Their suspicions had been correct as the monster hung upside down on the largest dead branch, hopefully in slumber. As they began to pass it they stuck to hiding beneath the railing hoping not to disturb the monster. When they were out a quarter mile from the tree Will and Ara knelt down for a break laying their feet out so their knees could have a rest. They didn't talk, they only sat a moment as Will lay his back down against the railing it gave out causing a piece of the medal panel to fall. The sound echoed in the short valley causing a large rumble, assumedly from the beast. Ara looked at Will with an expression that said "Why the hell did you do that?" while Will only could mouth the words "Oh Shit Oh Shit Oh Shit..." The creature instead seemed to head in the opposite direction panicked by his ajar lunchbox. Ara looked over Will to see what the beast was doing. Seeing his movements; she grabbed Will and began to pull him down the road forgoing their cover. When they reached a distance where they could read the green sign, they could make out that a gas station lay ahead two miles and a town some thirteen miles after. "We have gotta make it to that station" Will only aspirated with an agreeing head nod. "You really need to run more." Said Ara as she pulled him. "I'm.. not.. that.. out of..." Will tripped on a rock and landed once again on his face. "Shape." Will finished. Ara picked him up just as a large roar could be heard over the hill. "Shit, looks like he found his breakfast ran on him." Heaving, Will spoke between breaths. "You mean... its a dine... and dash?" "OH SHUT UP!" Ara said trying to hide her fatigued smile as they ran. Will knew now was not the time for jokes, but he couldn't help but notice Ara's smile. It was funny and she knew it. The road became steep as the gas station came into sight. It lay just beneath them on the slick road. They could hear the creature scampering not far behind them having picked up their scent. Ara tried to analyze the situation; at this pace they were not going to outrun the monster. Will looked at Ara studying the situation, without much hesitation he said "Do you trust me?" Before she could answer tripped her and pushed her jumping after her. Ara hit her butt on the slick ground hard at once realizing what Will had done. The road was mostly covered in ice and the road seemed to only head towards the station. As they were rushing down the hill Will grabbed Ara as she headed towards an exposed dry patch. "Grab my hand!" William exclaimed. Will in one hand held Ara, in the other he used his crowbar to pull to the right to avoid the dry patch resulting in hitting a slicker portion of ice. Behind them as they neared the bottom they could see the Yeti had encountered it's first patch and had slipped causing it to latch its claws in the ground. It stopped itself halfway down and began to carefully work its way down. Will leveraged his crowbar into the ice as they approached the gas station. Coming to a skidding stop Will and Ara rushed inside locking the door behind them with a newspaper stand. "Yeah, that's not going to work." Will said looking about the ransacked station. Immediately they ran through the racks of empty shelves and tried to push one in front of the door. "Shit, they're all bolted." "Use the crowbar!" said Ara looking about the store looking for materials to kill this thing with. Will knelt down and tried to pry the shelf up as a loud roar and a crash interrupted his struggle sending him back. Ara jumped behind the deck to find a dead hunter from year's prior had left half his body and a bow and two arrows. "Yes." She said as she looked above the counter. Will tried to slowly backup as the Yeti swiped the rows of shelf's cascading down over Will's foot. "Fuck!" He yelled as the creature climbed on to the shelves crushing his leg. Ara took the bow from the corpse hoping that the string was still good. She pulled back the string with the bow and aimed at it's back. She released the first arrow traveling with a whistle. With a flash the creature turn and caught the arrow in its clawed hand giving a creepy grimace towards Ara. Shit. Will started to scoot around on the ground with his crushed foot to reach Ara as the monster threw the arrow to the side and rushed her. It jumped over the counter clearing some of the ceiling tiles as Ara ducked and rolled less than gracefully. "Ara!" Will yelled as he crawled to where the arrow was and grabbed it. She got up and ran to the opposite side of the store towards her knife on the ground, she threw the bow at Will yelling "When I get in front of it, shoot it!" The monster chased after her crashing into the many stands in the way shouldering the glass screeching all the while. Will sat himself up as he pulled the bow and arrow back. "Snap". The string on the bow gave out. "Fuck!" Ara ran towards the back taking a sharp turn causing the Yeti to smash into the old milk refrigerator section. As Ara ran towards William who propped himself on the ground Ara screamed "Shoot!" "I can't!" yelled William as Ara noticed the string-less bow. The creature jumped at her heel causing her to slide just in front of Will. To William it appeared as if time had slowed down. He watched the scene as Ara turned to face her enemy. The Yeti lurched its ugly white body at her opening it's hideous spiky mouth ready for it's meal. All four black open eyes stared at its meal forgoing anything but the girl. William reacted in a flash vaulting forward on his good leg. He had only moment's before the Yeti's swipe would strike as he stuck the arrow through its left eye. He could feel the arrow penetrate the soft eye and go directly in the creature's head. It was slow to him, yet it happened so fast. The agony of the Yeti could be felt through every fiber of Will's being. The creature trembled as it traveled forward, as if it knew in that delayed instance: It was dead. Time resumed and the hulking figure lay atop Ara and Will. Ara had stuck her knife in it's throat unaware that the thing had died only an instance prior. Hideous black goop gushed on her clothes. Will struggled trying to roll the dead thing off of them. She had been surprised to see an arrow sticking in the monster's head once she got out from under it's hulking body. She wiped the black blood from her face as Will only silently stared at her. He had so calmly done the act and he was beyond himself by how his instincts had taken over so readily. After Ara got out from under the dead creature's body she leaned against the wall with Will. They had survived; they had survived another day in the middle of the frozen waste. Will was in serious pain and upon inspection of the station the only readily available sprain relief was an old wool parka from the convenience store merchandising days. Ara cut the parka just like her dad had taught her wrapping it around his ankle; they would spend a day here recuperating at the least. Will and Ara sat behind the counter that night burning a fire inside the cold gas station. "But mom... I found it all alone, can we keep it?" Will said after a moment of silence. Ara tiredly gave a grin "No honey, its just too much responsibility..." Will bent down and kissed her on the forehead to indicate he appreciated her humoring him. "I think we should skin it." Ara looked at it and then back to Will. "Why?" Will adjust himself. "Well.." he said grabbing the kitchen knife. "We could use the extra warmth for one, we could also scare off attackers if we wear it's skin, or possibly scare its counterparts." Ara gave a look of confusion. "Alright great mighty huntsman William" she said with a smirk. "Are you sure this has anything to do with surviving?" Will shrugged. "It also seemed like a cool idea. Native Americans used to do it, and I read it was always for survival reasons... and because they wanted to maybe show off." He said looking at the ceiling. Ara weighed the effort in her head for the reward. "Alright, but you are skinning it." Will's expression was uncontainable excitement. She knew this had been a huge triumph amongst an otherwise terrifying day. "Fine." Will got up and hobbled over to the body. Ara was not too happy about being displaced with her heat source disturbed. "Hey! You don't have to do it tonight!" "Yeah, but I'm cold." He said peering back at her smiling. "Do you know how to skin?" "Nope!" she said snuggling up in their pile of stuff. "I guess there's always a first time for everything." Will plunged the knife in the belly and began to clean the mutated animal with about as much grace as a child cutting wrapping paper. With relative ease the skin peeled off with an oily give. "That's disgusting." Said Will as he finished pulling off the furry skin. "Smells good too." Said Ara holding her nose. Will motioned for Ara to join him as they hobbled and dragged the body out for the wasteland to reclaim. After much panting they resumed where they had stowed themselves and called it a night. They had made much ground towards an ever unknown destination. And they'd done so with courage.?Chapter 8: Quebec, Romeo Juliet	"I wonder if it's edible." Ara glanced at Will with a look of disgust. "You don't know what it is, how could you think of eating it?" Will picked up his bag and placed it on the counter as he packed up their encampment. "Hey, I'm just saying." He moved his shoulders innocently "I wouldn't knock it until you try it." Ara made a gagging face in protest. "Not today, not tomorrow.." She said. "Not with green eggs and ham?" Will offered as they approached the door. "What?" "Nevermind." Will thought a moment at how unlucky Ara must have been to not know such great literary works. Apparently her dad never showed her the wonder of the good docter. "Will." Ara said stopping him abruptly. "What?" "You didn't touch the Yeti did you?" Will looked down. "Jesus fuck." Upon his brief inspection Will could see that a full claw was missing from the Yeti's corpse. "Someone... some thing.... Took..." "The hand." Finished Ara. "Whelp.." said Will pausing briefly. "Fuck that. Time to go!" Ara and Will quickly began to walk down the road towards the supposed city the sign had pointed to only a day prior. After they had made some progress down the road, somewhat slower than the day before on account of Will's ankle and the lacking of hungry Yeti's abound, Will turned to look at the disappearing station. "What do you think did that?" Ara shook her head. "I don't know." She paused. "I don't want to know." They kept a constant pace walking where they could see the road, Ara had learned early on that roads were not structures she trusted; Will was content to follow her orders on the subject. The cold was doing hideous things to Will's joints as they walked on prompting a rest atop a hill. While Will rewrapped his leg Ara surveyed their surroundings, she noted city ruins lay to the North and behind them lay the fenced fields running to the gas station. "All this used to be beautiful farmland." Ara said after a moment gazing into the fields. "It still is." Said Will observing the picturesque snowy landscape. "No." said Ara. "There are no more farmers." Will shook his head: "I guess you have a point." "Just fields of empty crops, dead animals, furry monsters and random posts." Will followed her vision "Hon." Will got up and peered. "Yeah?" she said looking at him as he wobbled forward. "That post you pointed out is oddly shaped." Immediately, Ara grabbed Will's bag and began pulling him away. Will tried to discern what it was, all he knew, was that it was moving their direction. 	      "Shit, Will!" Ara cried as she stared down the ice hole. "Will! Can you still hear me?" "Ara..." she heard faintly. Damn, how much abuse is that boy going to take? She thought. She heard a scuffle behind her. The sound of white noise resonating higher and higher pervaded the cold air. She took a chance and dove into the icy cave. As she slid down the treacherous sinkhole a sharp searing pain ripped through her jeans. She cried out in pain as she hit the bottom of the tunnel collapsing into something soft. "Will?" "Hruhhh" it said. Will rolled over from is side to see what hit him. "Ara?" She sat up wincing at her bruised ribs, "Hey hon." Ara glanced up while she helped Will roll over and sat him up against the cold icy wall. Much as she expected whatever had been following them had not wanted to risk the fall. "Wha-what happened?" said Will shaking his head. Ara grabbed him and assessed him for damage. "You slid down a sinkhole when we were running from that... that thing, and I guess it didn't want to follow." She glanced once again towards the hole above them. Will propped his leg up so that Ara could continue to inspect him. "Did you land on your leg?" "No, it was mostly my ass, I think." "Good, we need to find our way out of here before that thing.." As Ara finished her words she panned to see the small hideous creature standing five feet from them. It stood their motionless as Will and Ara stared at it. It stood at a whopping four feet tall, it bore the skin of animals all of it's body, and it had big black eyeglasses covering its eyes. On it's right hand it held a glove made from the Yeti's hand and on it's back it wore a backpack with strange sticks standing out of it. It stood menacingly with it's... wait. Is that curly blond hair? "Delta?". It said slowly in it's cutesy little voice. Ara and Will only could continue to stare. It spoke again "Delta?" it said. "What?" "Delta Roger." It repeated seeming impatient. It only rocked back and forth on it's feet still with an air of impatience. Ara pressed her hand on Will's chest as she leaned forward. "Ara" Will objected. She got close to the creature kneeling so that it could be eye level with it. She slowly, with trembling hands pulled the glasses from it's face; brilliant blue eyes under blond eyebrows met her. Will gasped as their pursuer was revealed to be a little girl. She kept her scarf across her face, but it was undeniable that this little girl had been on her own for quite a while. "Delta Roger?" she said with a raised eyebrow. "Delta Roger? "Why do you keep saying that?" said Ara with eyebrows bunched. The girl only stared. 	Will stared across the cave at Roger as Ara went about fixing his foot wraps. With the firelight she was using some sort of torch she had hooked to what appears to be a propane tank to melt this metal onto a piece of copper board. She sat humming to herself with a pair of clear glasses over her face as she worked. Every once and a while she would pause what she was doing to listen to an earpiece in her ear like she was some sort of secret agent. "What do you think she's doing?" "I haven't a clue?" said Ara pausing to look at her. Ara considered this amongst the strangest spectacles she'd ever seen. The air hung with the sweet smell of whatever metal she was burning out of a spool. "How old do you think she is?" "Eight or nine?"Ara finished putting his boot on to him and sat next to him watching the little girl work with her hair in a ponytail. As she worked she would refer to a bracelet on her arm that held a series of colored beads carefully selecting little wired components that had similar markings. The little girl inspected what she had made and unpacked a flashlight from her bag. She twisted off the back and pulled a few wires from the inside connecting it to a square coke can sized battery. "She's got to be holding forty pounds or more of equipment" said Ara noting her large backpack with a red and white cross in the center. "How has she survived this long?" said Will. "I just don't know..." The girl began to shake the flashlight vigorously once both leads were connected to the battery. The couple watched her silently as she did this for a while. After a while she retired from this activity and hooked the battery to the device she had been working on. After she flipped a switch on her board a bright arc across two poles emerged. She pulled a pair of pliers from her belt and put a small piece of metal between the arc causing a huge flash. She smiled and declared "Tango!". She looked at Ara and Will with a look of excitement as she showed off her creation.  Will only nodded to show he understood she had made something, whatever it was. She had taken off her Yeti glove and attached paperclips in coils around two of the fingers.  She finished connecting her device to the claw and put it on using old black tape to secure it. She then proceeded to charge it and she looked around looking for something to test it on. Finding nothing else she quickly walked over to Will and sat next to him. "What are you?" With a quick hand she turned on the device and poked him in the leg sending a huge shock through his body. "What the fu... " He convulsed as Ara pulled her fist up to engage. Roger backed away quickly seeing she had caused. "Kaybec Kaybec Kaybec" she said quickly backing away pulling the glove off and backing up from him. Ara had in an instance stood up with fist ready to smack her. She backed off into her corner and sat down rocking back and forth. Will grabbed Ara's leg. "Don't. " he muttered.  "What? She's dangerous!" Will pulled her back. "She's just a child, she didn't know she was going to hurt me just like she didn't know she was going to hurt you earlier!" Ara stared at the little frightened girl. "Ara.." Will said as she back down. The little girl stopped rocking and looked across the cave at the two larger humans. She said quietly "Kuebec Romeo, Kuebec Juliet." She pulled her equipment back into her corner and unpacked a sleeping bag that was twice as big as her. She crawled in it like a cat and snuggled herself inside of it leaning her head against her backpack. Will and Ara sat next to each other watching her as she slept. "Kuebec Romeo, Kuebec Juliet?" Will said softly out loud. "Was she apologizing?" Ara looked at him. "Apologizing?" "Well... hear me out on this one. I don't think she can read, so how would she know anything about Romeo and Juliet, two pivotal characters in Shakespeare's self-titled play?" "I don't know what you are talking about." "Oh right, I guess you had no time for that level of reading and literature." "I can still read.." she said pouty, looking away. "No no no, that's not what I meant." Said Will retracing his steps. "What I am saying is I think she doesn't know English in the same context we do." Ara gave him an eyebrow. "Oh?" she said. "So I've been listening to her as she's been rambling and I think she only knows twenty six words." "What?" "Shhh!!" said Will motioning for her to lower her voice, it hadn't hit Ara that she was progressively getting louder. "Oop, sorry." After a moment. "Why twenty-six?" Her curiousity was bated. Will explained "She'd only saying words that come from the phonetic alphabet. Sailors used to use it, and possibly the military" "So is she a sailor's kid?" "Doubtable" said Will looking back at her. "But I think she must have learned those terms somehow." "You mean like "Quebec"?" "Do you think that's her word for "sorry"?" Will stared at her a while. "I think she speaks in a pseudo code I read in a book once. Like, back before there was a way of communicating using waves in the air." "You mean radio?" Said Ara making Will feel stupid. "Yes, erm sorry... I think she speaks in the phonetic radio psuedocode." "Bless you." Said Ara being facetious. Will continued. "I think she must have heard a radio when she was young and all of her communication was developed around those implied meanings. She knows that Juliet is a girls name so she associates it with you. And Romeo is a guy's name, so to her I am Romeo, maybe not the Romeo, but I am a Romeo." "What about Quebec?" "Well, I think it's her way of apologizing, must be some context we never knew." The two watched the sleeping little monster as she drooled all over herself. Will held Ara close. "She may be inventive, but I hope she's potty trained as well." Ara giggled as they cuddled next to each other. They both watched as the girl peacefully, and without any fear snored away. Tomorrow would be an interesting day.	?Chapter 9: The lost princess.Nature has this incredible way of surprising you at every turn. So much in this world comes from such pocketed and precise structures that make up our fabric of being. Yet, compounded together they produce these incredibly complex structures. Will stared at the icicles on the ceiling of the cave wondering about the fabric of being. Ara awoke softly next to him catching him once again in his wandering mind. She left him there to visually check whether Roger was still real. "Will" she said tapping his shoulder. "Yea...." Will stopped as he turned his head. Roger was sound asleep. Blood stained her neck and her mouth and next to her lay a dead one antlered deer. The little girl cuddled with the missing antler. Evidently she had snuck out for a snack during the night. Ara and Will sat wide-eyed for a moment. This was a seriously scary little girl. After a moment of un-breaking, and quite smelly silence Will said. "Well you said you always wanted a little girl." Ara gave him the obligatory slap for bad jokes and then proceeded to pack the camp. The crazy little fiend stayed asleep sucking on the antler a bit. "Should we leave her?" Will said to Ara as they stood around looking at the messy deer gore she had left. "I'm not entirely convinced she won't do that to us." "Yeah, but she's healthy and human." Said Will. "I'm still not convinced on that first point." said Ara with her arms crossed. "I think we should bring her, she might be useful, for you know, throwing at crazy beasts. I don't think it's right to leave her." Will said as they walked out of the side entrance to he cave.  Ara stood at the entrance and pointed to the pile of organs the little girl had left as a warning to other animals. "That's some psychotic shit Will." "Nah, I think it's a survival thing." He said trying not to look or smell the deer organs. Ara turned to look back at the cave to see the little girl had woken quietly and packed her stuff. She stood at the entrance of the cave with wet eyes. She knew what they were discussing. Ara and Will stood a moment in panic. Ara felt overwhelmingly terrible for having the child witness their possible abandoning of her. She slowly walked forward with tears streaming down her eyes and she grabbed Will's hand slowly and stood there. "Papa Echo Hotel." She said extending her other hand to Ara. Ara slowly reached out her hand and held it. "I think she wants to stay with us." Will humored in his head "O'hana means family." But decided not to share on this occasion. "Roger." Said the little girl looking at Ara. Ara looked out at the barren frozen wasteland remembering how scary and isolated her time by herself had been. She looked down briefly at the gorgeous blue eyes that stared her down with her cutesy backpack the size of her. "Fine." Said Ara, beginning to walk North. "Roger!" said Roger as she walked between them holding Will's hand. 		Every so often Ara would look at Roger to study her and figure out what strange instruments she carried. She had a blowtorch sticking out of her backpack, the weird metal sticks, including a coiled stick, and under her arms she had two bulky objects that appeared to be guns. Her claw weapon that she had hand-fashioned was loosely attached to her belt with wires running to the backpack. On her pack she had hand sewed a piece of cloth with an eagle holding a shield with a plant and sticks in each claw. "What do you think the patch on her backpack means?" Roger seemed disgruntled that she wasn't asked pulling twisting her hooded face to look between Will and Ara, she knew they were talking about her. Will leaned to get a better view. "Looks like an old government thing." Said Will. Roger briefly put her hand to her earpiece out of habit and returned her hands now back to her pocket. Will tried to picture what she reminded him of. She had her hood on and her black shades, her earpiece, and guns under her arms. "I think she's a secret agent." Said Will teasingly. "How's that?" said Ara laughing. "Look at her, she's got all the equipment to be a spy or an agent. "I guess, I don't really know what they look li..." "Get down Mr. President!" Roger yelled as she tackled Ara into a pit. Will turned to see what Roger was getting antsy about only to see red and white sticks along the deer trail they had been following. Will understood immediately as he traced his footsteps back to where Ara's last step was going to be. She almost stepped on a mine. "What the hell?" said Ara trying to get Roger off of her. "Ara..." "What?" she said looking furiously at the frozen Will. "Don't move." Ara stiffened and examined her surroundings as Roger clutched her tight. "Oh shit." Ara looked at Will and then at Roger, who had taken off her glasses now. "You saved my life." "Echo". Ara held Roger for a second until she squirmed out of her hug. She sat up placing her feet carefully as she stood next to Will. The city they were aiming for stood within a mile of their current position and an entire field of mine's stood in the way. "Shit." Said Will. "How are we going to get in?" Ara said looking at the sticks that dotted the outskirts. A makeshift wall had been assembled around the exterior of the city. Most likely a preservative measure made during the transitional years after the great events. Roger produced a pair of binoculars and handed them to Will while he dug farther into her backpack. She stared coiling wires and she pulled one of the sticks from the ground most likely indicating a mine. Ara and Will shuttered as she did so. "She's going to get herself killed." Said Ara. "Nah, I don't think she can trip the mines." I think she's light enough." Ara watched as once again the little girl assembled a device using two sticks she'd pulled from mines.  Ara said "What she doing?" said Ara. "She knows she can get through." Replied Will watching as Roger once again created a device on the fly. "Hotel" replied Roger knowingly. She pulled her torch out and began to solder a small light in between the connection and then proceeded to pull out her flashlight and shake it. She taped the contraption on the end of her sticks and hovered the device three inches from the ground near one of the sticks. Will speculated for a moment. "I think she's trying to find a way we can go too." She hovered there for a moment until the light turned on. "Brilliant! She made a metal detector!" Ara's eyebrows shot up. "She's good." Roger smiled beamingly for a moment and then her smile faded as she yelled "Lima Lima!" Ara and Will turned, not a hundred feet from them sat two what was assumed was once men walking on five feet poles on their hands and feet. One of them screeched and began rushing towards them. Without a moment's hesitation Roger pulled Ara's hand and began quickly navigating through the mind field. Will followed placing his feet exactly where instructed. The two pole scavengers rushed in for their soon to be dead meal. They had apparently been feeding off of desperate individuals or creatures trying to get into the city using the mind field as their trap. They each wore ragged black robes that draped over them and under they dangled animal spines like tails behind them. On their face they wore the skulls of assumed birds and their long ragged hair hung to the sides. Carefully they poled after the three slow-moving targets using the intermediate soft spots between the mine indicators as their footing. They seemed to be gaining on the group as they ran through the mine field with Roger focused entirely on the ground. Will was keeping an eye on the screeching pole scavengers behind them and Ara kept an eye on Roger while keeping the limping Will behind her. The closer to the wall it seemed the more arrows lay around them. Only with a resounding thud was it evident that they were walking into a double trap. That thud, was the sound of an arrow piercing Ara's shoulder as she screamed in pain falling to the ground. Roger turned to see what was happening and briefly stopped. Will went to Ara as more arrows pounded the soft earth at them. One of the screeching creature's behind them was hit by an arrow and lost his footing falling into a mine causing a shocking explosion behind them. The other pole scavenger stopped pursuit to stay out of the range of the city dweller's arrows. Ara could feel a drought or poison hitting her as she was losing consciousness. The walls of the city folded out in crumbling places where dark archers stood waiting to kill the intruders. Roger stood in front of the group as a large figure broke from the group. It wore a long skirt and it carried a ram's horn. All the figure's it commanded had either no hair or braided dreads all covered in black soot. The bodies of all of the figures were painted grey and black, except for the large one, who bore a single white hand upside down on his sternum. He was definitely the figure in charge. He pointed at Will and instructed he approach. Will looked behind him to see the scavenger had ran off and he turned to Ara to see she had passed out. Will stood up and raised his hands to show his defeat. Roger only looked forward with anger and vengeance. The large figure approached the edge of the minefield and began walking towards them, his archers behind him stood at the edge of the field pointing arrows at him. He silently walked with calmness to the place where they stood with no regards to the mines. Roger slowly turned her metal detector around her to see that there indeed was still metal in the ground. The large figure stood at seven feet tall dwarfing Will, Ara, and Roger.  Will stood there until the figure beckoned he follow. Roger looked to Will to see what he'd do. Will picked up Ara, who had long since fainted and carried her along the path the large man had silently specified. Roger reluctantly followed next to him putting her free hand on his belt. Roger squeezed on his belt every time he passed a stick as she scanned the metal underneath. As they reached the end of the field a party lie waiting with spiked tools and arrow launching devices. It occurred to Will that the mines on one side of the field were probably fake. That's clever as fuck. Thought Will as he was escorted into the walls of the black city. The large figure lead the front of the escort giving one solid blow to the horn. He looked back at the three captives he'd bagged with an unemotional face. Will studied his surroundings as he hoisted Ara through the dirty soot covered city.  They had no choice. They we're now in unfriendly territory, with weapons pointed at them every step they took. It was covered in soot everywhere and in all dark corners and crevices eyes seemed to watch them. The Settlement had once been a downtown section of some prewar city barricaded from the rest of the world. All the people around him seemed to have the same grey and black paint or soot on them and they all stared through hollowed eyes. A part of the city lay collapsed toward the center they lead into wooden bridges lined the way down into the pit. Will could see yellow light pouring from the inside of the pit and in smoky holes he could see the inhabitants of this dirty city melting whole cars pouring them into concrete buckets. This whole city was a factory. Will could smell the burning, the smelting, and he could see exactly where the black smoke and fumes that pervaded the area were coming from. The thousands of resident that worked and lived in the cursed city were pumping, boiling, steaming, melting, and forging metal into something. Will's mind raced. Food was a scarcity everywhere they went and it occurred to Will that they must have a reliable source of food to be able to support a city this grand.  As if to answer his question they passed by hanging cages as they headed deeper into their lair. Will almost threw up as he saw children and old people sitting in the cages. That's how they controlled their population. Will grabbed onto Roger's hand and ushered her closer. In the midst of the silent tour she had put her glove on her hand and in the other she gripped her metal detector tight.  She had figured out the stakes quietly as well. As they approached the bottom of the pit a lone chair sat upon a pile of books forming a makeshift throne. The books were stepped, as if it were a Mayan temple and sitting at the top a lone figure sat. The Big One grabbed Ara from Will's hand as if he was being polite and pushed Will and Roger to the top of the stack. The lone figure wore a hood and a long robe concealing everything about him except his bony white hands. The figure at candle light read a book held by one of his subjects who held a magnifying glass as still as her life depended on it. The book holder and Will met eyes as he approached, she moved not, but studied him intensely. He looked goofy.  One of the white hands held up and the book and book-girl was dismissed. As she walked down the steps Will got a good look at her, she wore practically nothing, which he hoped his cheeks didn't betray him for noticing. She wore a black bra, most likely as a symbol of sexual recognition as one of the tribe's breeders and she had on what appeared to be black tennis shoes. She looked odd wearing pretty much underwear, a skirt, and tennis shoes with the black and grey stroke pattern that echoes that of flannel across her body. Will got the impression she was not to be touched... at all. As the two passed each other she communicated with eyes that shot a "run" message to him. He gulped as he and his young little monster girl walked up the last steps in front of the white-handed figure. Two torches sat next to him burning eternally. He motioned for Will to stop as he approached the top. Will stood with Roger for a moment of unceasing silence as the figure studied him. "Who destroyed us?" said the figure in a dark old voice. Will stood for a moment thinking, unsure of what to reply. "Charlie." Said Roger abruptly, shocking the room. The hooded figure chuckled. "Charlie? Close." Roger smiled as if she had just told a joke. "You child, have a sense of humor I haven't heard in quite a while, and a wisdom for your age. Come here child." The left hand motioned for her to join him on the chair. She cautiously approached standing in front of him. "Turn around." He motioned in a circle studying her. "Stop" he said seeing the emblem on her backpack. One of his figures standing next to him was motioned to secure the patch on her backpack. "Easy now child." Said the figure as she growled at the figure touching her backpack. "I want to see your flag, your banner of honor." Roger stared at Will as the piece of cloth was forcibly removed from her backpack. Roger seemed pissed. "There's a symbol I have not seen n a long time." He slowly pet the material in his hand. "My children of the dark never saw this symbol when it was flown, and when it was stricken to the ground. Do you know what this means?" the figure said pointing at Will. Trying to find the courage in his words he squeaked out "the United States of America?" "Good, close, but wrong. Turn around." He said to Roger. The figure scanned the little girl more using what eyesight it had left. It slowly pulled back it's hood to produce an old man's face. With a quick stifling Will tried to maintain composure as he saw the oldest living face he'd ever seen with holes in his cheeks. The holes were kept open by metal rings that had rusted slightly. The old man's brown eyes had yellow tint around them. The man's fading hair was a clue to how old he was which his pearly white teeth offset. They seemed unnaturally white in contrast to his face and hair all scraggily and old. He softly looked at Will. "Do you know who this is?" he said pointing at Roger. "Roger?" said Will. "Roger is it?" said the old man. "I think not, this is Emilee. Named after her mother." He chuckled amused. "Princess Emilee, is what I'll call you. After all, your father had the status of a king." Roger and Will exchanged glances, not knowing what he was talking about. "Oh you don't know either do you?" said the old man with fake concern. "You see, your Daddy is the reason we live this way." Said the old man with a vicious change in personality. Roger started to back up towards Will. "Your Daddy was the devil who created this carnage. Look at my sick and dying children, Princess!" He pointed to all of the figures in the open cave. "Look at the pestilence you wrought upon them, see the cancer that eats away at their health. Look what life you stole from them!" Will scanned the room at the sickly looking children the man described, most of them had boils and growths on them making them appear like plague victims. "What leader of the free world would do this to his own country, what president abandons his own people to see them slink into the dark? Your father!" he said pointing towards Emilee Roger. "That's why we shot his plane down those long year's ago and still you survive, a living pestilence of his dying commands. He tried to flee the country once he knew the world was ending and we watched his plane burn to the ground. And yet..." He said standing with some effort wailing towards Will and Roger as they backed down the stairs. "And yet... you live, the last princess of America's dynasty. Take them." The old angry man pointed his bony white hands and the children of the dark ascended on them pulling them towards the cells across the bridge. Will tried to fight them kicking two of them off the bridge plummeting to their death in the working camps below. The Big One had relinquished Ara to a smaller group to be stuffed into a smaller cage. He quickly descended on the group having no trouble as he picked Roger's slashing self by her backpack and Will by his neck and threw them into a cage. He had Ara put in a cage across the chasm and he stood silently watching the gasping boy and little girl.  A horn was sounded and the group retreated leaving several skinny guards watching the cage. Will had hit his head on the metal walls of their cage. Roger clasped onto Will scared for her life. Will raised his head and looked out across the chasm to where Ara was being kept. The two silent guards paid no attention to him and stood out of reach. He and Roger examined their cage. The Settlement was an industrious complex that had retained the secrets of metallurgy and had quickly became good constructors of weapons and apparently cages. Will tested the strength of the bars with his fists to find he was moreover and idiot. Crying in pain the two guards gave him a quick glances coming to the same conclusion that he was an idiot for trying to take down a form of steel with his bare hands. Roger on the otherhand sat fiddling with her backpack grabbing a brick of clay and some wire. She quietly behind her back was forming putty balls and she slowly made her way to the cell entrance placing the putty around the frame. Will silently watched as she ran wire discreetly to this location and she sat in the back trying to wire up a power source. Will backed up from the door sensing her devious plan was to somehow unhinge the door using this putty. She sat frustratingly trying to get her device to work finding that her battery had been broken when she was tossed into the cell. She started to tear up realizing she couldn't do whatever she needed to do. Will whispered to her "What do you need?".  Roger sat a moment trying to think of how she would be able to build a power source. She sat a moment pouring through her backpack. Will looked out towards the guards trying to keep watch. He realized they weren't concerned in the least, most likely no one had ever managed to escape from a steel reinforced cage. Seemed reasonable. A shuffling next to him made him refocus back on the tiny genius next to him. She held in her hands a scrap of aluminum from a tin screw and a piece of copper. She drew the shape of round thing on the ground. "What is that?" Will asked quietly she motioned towards the materials in her hand "Tango" she said quietly. Will put his hands out and made a face. "I don't know what that means." She tried redrawing the potato shape and that's all he could make out of it. His attention was shortened when the book girl arrived with food. Both of the guards she tried to dismiss as she set food under the door. She stared at Will intently as she motioned to slide the food his way. Her hand was caught by one of the guards as he pulled the food back. He detained her as the other guard searched the food finding the key she had tried to slip them. He slapped her and knocked her to the ground opening the cell next to them tossing her in. Will and Roger silently sat there trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible. The guards resumed their positions, this time staying focused on anyone passing by the cages, they had failed to see the putty on the door, and the wires Roger had cleverly wrung along the side of the cage. Will looked over at the recovering "panty model". She was pretty knocked up and when their eyes met he could see she could only see out of one of her eyes. He nodded towards her as a sort of "good effort". She gave a wry twitch of the mouth, a sort of "I tried". The rest of the inmates in the adjoining cells had been watching and now servants came by to pass food out with the guards focusing intently this time on the two cages in front of them. Before food was passed out they inspected all of the plates, this time they would not be fooled. When the food was passed from it's inspection they were slid under the door to their captives. Will and Roger received a metal pan of meat that looked absolutely horrid. Roger eagerly went to eat it, but Will remembered that this tribe balanced it's meals by eating their over abundant population. Will grabbed Roger before she could get her hands on it and he stared her in the eyes. "Don't eat that." Roger seemed disappointed and although Will knew she could and would eat anything raw he was not interested in getting her addicted to meat so soon. The panty model was given a different meal as she was expected to be healthier Will presumed. On her tin plate she had small-deformed carrots, mushrooms, and warped potatoes. When Roger saw her plate she poked Will excitedly and motioned to wards her plate. Will tried to make sense of the non-verbal communication he'd had pretty much his entire time here. She kept pointing at the plate and then back to the drawing on the floor. Finally, it clicked. The potatoes. She was trying to make a potato battery to ignite the assumed explosive putty. Roger was a fucking genius. The girl in the next cell was about to eat the largest spud and Will cleared his throat before she put it in her mouth. The she and the guards both looked at him he turned his head to pretend like he was actually clearing his throat. The guards, though suspicious decided not to care, what could they possibly do? The panty model continued to stare sensing her possible freedom. Will motioned for her to toss the potato his way; she hesitated. He pointed at Roger, whom showed her the materials in her hand, and then pointed at the putty hidden on their side of the cell. She didn't quite understand how this would help, but she threw the potato on faith hoping that the jailbirds would also free her. The potato deflected on the bar making a ringing sound getting the guards attention, Will quickly punched the cage again throwing his body in between the guards and the hidden potato. He guards looked at him, reminded themselves that this was the idiot who thought he could punch through walls and returned back to their silent staring contest with the rest of the cavern. Will hoped that all this pain in his hand was worth getting Roger and Ara out of here. Roger crept to the potato and inserted the two metals into either side making her nodes. She motioned for Will to grab the torch and be ready to use it and she put her claw on her hand as she prepared to blow her way out of this joint. All three of the inmates involved sat for three breaths counting in their head before the two outsiders shielded themselves against the corner of the cell and connected the potato to the wires. 	In a haze the door had exploded and shot forward hitting the two guards knocking them senseless against small cave wall they had been leaning against. Will and Roger ran out quickly to where the guards were grabbing the keys and flinging it towards the girl in the cell next to them. All of the inmates around them began to make uproar as they freed only one of them. As soon as the girl was out she tossed the keys to the cell next to her as the three of them headed across the bridge. They couldn't save everyone, but at least they gave them a chance... and hopefully a distraction. As the got to the other side of the bridge they ran left to where Will had seen Ara carried off. He turned down one of the chasms to find the meat room where people were harvested. Slung up on one of the tables lie Ara. Will's heart froze as he looked at the scene. Two of the dark children stood with knives in their hand, as they were about to cut into the mostly undressed Ara. Will grabbed a knife on the table next to him and approached with the clawed Roger close behind. The two meat boys went swinging as the two outsiders brutally, and in Roger's case dirtily dismembered them. Will had never been so angry and felt so bloodthirsty in his life. In the process of dispatching the two meat heads and freeing the passed out Ara he had lost the top nip of his left ear to a meat head chewing on it and with the swipe of a knife to the jugular from the panty model the meat head was ended. After the gory scene Will picked Ara off from the table and quickly threw her over his shoulder, he had no time to worry about anything else, if she was dead he'd have to find out later. The three and a half made their way down the corridor being lead by the panty model who seemed to know a way out. She ran them to an old sewer grate and with Will's aid they tried to loosen it placing Ara on the floor with Roger watching her. Before Will could get in he heard the footsteps of a giant and was not relieved to see the form of the Big One walking down the hall. The big one walked with great speed as he made for them. The book girl put her hand on Will's to motion for him to stand down. The Big One slowed down and stared down Will and then without so much as a consideration grabbed the sewer gate and ripped it open. He motioned with his head that they should go. The tall panty model cried big tears as he helped them into the sewer grate. She grabbed his head as he went to put the grate back and she gave him a passionate farewell kiss. He nodded his head in goodbye and slammed the grate back into the wall as a group of the dark children came running his way. He put his back to grate and fought them off to give them a head start as they crawled down the pipe.  The panty model cried as they heard the sound of his last battle cries.  As they got to the end of the pipe a loud sound of rushing water could be heard, Will grabbed everyone's hands and pulled them down the rushing slope as the sound of their pursuer's got closer. When the pursuer's got there they found smeared grey and black paint from their betraying sister and quick rapids too dangerous to pursue them in. ?Chapter 10: Black FridayThe water was freezing, but it was the kind of cold that made you feel alive. Never having known freedom Kimarus didn't know what a cold bath felt like. Granted, the cold bath was a quick floundering underwater as disgusting acidic fluids pushed the saviors and their rescuee downstream, but it was a cold bath to remember. A baptism it felt like, renewed, reenergized, washing away the grey and black soot of the Settlement. Kimarus thought about Baridius, the Big One had been the hero for the last time. It was sad, but it was also enlightening to be free, he would have wanted me to live that way Kimarus had reasoned being flung down a series of underwater passageways trying desperately not to let go of the others. Who were these people anyways? What made them special enough to save me? What made me special enough to save? "Wham" The group slammed into a grate as Will and Ara tried to pull them from the water. They had hit a grate at the end of the tunnel and they worked quickly to climb out and pull Roger and Kimarus out of the freezing water.  Ara didn't know who the new girl was, but she assumed that she was responsible for their rescue, her pale body was the brightest thing in the dark grate-lit tunnel, and that was in competition with Roger's bright hair. As they all huddled next to each other for warmth Will and Ara noticed that the new-comer was not only pale, but definitely had a preexisting skin condition as her entire body looked like a tiger-print design. Kimarus caught both of them staring, Roger being indifferent to anything as she had just suffered the trauma of losing her backpack, and put her head down in resignation. Realizing their folly Ara quickly said: "What's your name?" Forgoing she knew not how they had got here and would later interrogate at the least Mr. William she figured she'd welcome the freezing newcomer. The girl looked shyly at all three of them and with an unexpectedly deeper voice said "Kimarus". Will rocked his head backwards in somewhat of a surprise at the vocal range of the woman and her strange name. "I'm Ara." "I'm Will" he said nervously. "Roger." Said Roger finally. "It's... nice to meet you." She said once again with her licorice voice. She coughed, once again putting the half-dressed team back on track. Both of the older girls were near stark naked and Roger was covered in soaked winter clothes that would surely make her freeze to death if they didn't find somewhere warmer. "Let's get out of here." Said Will as he picked the group up and lead them down the sewer passages. He didn't know if the dark children would follow them or not and if they stood still they would freeze to death. Ara found a ladder as they ran down the corridor and quickly climbed it to see if there was any way out of the freezing sewer. She lifted the grate to find a burned down city with snow covering nearly every inch. Damn is it cold. Will came up on the ladder under her and tapped her ankle. "Anything there?" Ara scanned, thinking fast she spots a mall. "I see a shopping center that might have at least clothes." "It's our best shot." Said Will as he quickly climbed after. Roger followed right after and Kimarus last. As he pulled them up they yelped at how much colder it was out here. Ara had already taken off for the mall and Will ended up being the last to get there on account of his still healing leg. Between Ara and Kimarus they were able to get the door open and to seal it after Will got there. Immediately they ran down the center of the mall as quietly as they could sticking to corners until they found a department store with clothes. The girls started grabbing whatever they could find and ran for the dressing room to get dressed. Will thought it kind of funny that they were using dressing rooms like they would in old days, but I guess even when the world ends women still want their privacy around other women. Will stripped wherever he found clothes walking stark naked in the store until he found a pair of pants suitable for the cold. The temperature, though low in the store was not nearly as low as he would have thought it should. He wasn't in the least bothered as he was still trying to dry himself. Roger was the first to come out of the dressing room in what appeared almost exactly to be the same clothes; she had found clothes that were quite on par with her consistent look. She grabbed a basket and walked towards the front. Will had finished finding a suitable jacket when he caught up with her and he heard the other dressing room doors open. "What are you doing Roger?" Roger didn't reply, instead she pilfered the drawers of the cashier's desk looking for supplies. "You are on a mission aren't you?" She nodded; she had to have her supplies if she was going to survive. Ara and Kimarus came out wearing winter gear holding more clothes for later. Will thought it was odd that Kimarus had preferred a set of guy's pants over girls, but he didn't bother making an issue about it. Fashion was almost literally dead. "So Kim, I noticed you ditched your shoes, want to run to a shoe store?" Kim's head nodded. They both looked at Roger, who had a basket full of paperclips and wads of gum. Apparently all of the girls wanted to go shopping. "I guess we can forage for supplies while we are here." Said Will as he stepped out into the center of the mall. He noted a shoe store and a hardware store down the way. "I'll take Roger to the hardware store to get supplies if you girls want to go get shoes for the rest of us." Roger nodded her head eagerly to this plan and quickly grabbed one of the pens she had confiscated and grabbed an old sign from the door making an outline of her foot. "How old is she?" said Kim. "We think nine or ten." Said Ara. "A" said Roger beaming holding both hands up to produce the number ten. "A?" "We don't know, she speaks in code, but she's absolutely brilliant and she seems to know what we are saying." "Roger" said Roger. Kim's head nodded "Well alright." Kim grabbed a hair tie from Roger's basket and quickly contained the braided dreads. "Let's do it." Said Ara as they headed out. Both teams grabbed a basket and headed opposite directions. "Hey, if you see any backpacks grab four." Said Will as he and Roger headed one way. "Will do hon!" Ara replied giving him a wink. Will smiled, almost felt like they were actually at the mall to shop. But everything was free, must be Black Friday. 	Ara got a good chance to look at Kim while they were looking for hiking shoes. She was really tall, if not taller than the clumsy goof she had came with and her shoulder's where broader too. On the back of her neck you could see the Blaschko lines, but her face remained free of the weird pigmentation. She had high cheekbones and strong arms, which made Ara suspicious. However, what definitely made her a woman was her huge bust and a butt that made Ara jealous. "Kim, has anyone ever told you you have a big butt?" Ara opened with. They had been silent for some time now as they were getting socks on. Kim's face went red. "No." "Well I'm half black and even I don't have a butt as big as you, why are you trying to conceal it in those big boy jeans?" Without think Kim said "That's not what I'm trying to hide." Ara noticed she had caught herself saying too much and she shut down the conversation. Something was up with her. "Do you have a disease?" Ara questioned, using her father's passed down knowledge to come to a conclusion.  "I'm a chimera." She said finally after a long pause. "So you are two people in one?" Kim was surprised at her level of knowledge. "Yeah, how do you know that term?" "My dad was a nurse long ago." "What happened to him?" Ara looked away. "He's gone." "Oh... I'm so sorry." Kim said. "It's all good, the past is the past. What about you, where did you come from?" Kim picked up a pair of hiking shoes examining them, "I was found by the Proctor wandering the streets outside the settlement when I was I guess about Roger's age." "The Proctor?" "The old man who rules the Settlement. Every forty two years a new Proctor is announced and he devours the old Proctor." Ara made a face of disgust at Kim as she continued throwing shoes in a basket. She was so preoccupied with her story Ara figured she had forgotten why they were doing it in the first place. "Well that's... nice..." said Ara changing the conversation. "I was the Patrician Conistinte, a title he rendered on me so that I could never be touched." "That's a fancy title.." "It was slavery and repression Ara." Said Kim turning savagely towards her. Ara could obviously see this was something she was very passionate about, you know, the whole repression and post-apocalyptic women's rights movement... It had only recently surfaced. Ara put up her hands defensively. "I'd never known the repression of women, I lived freely in the world, running from terrifying monsters all on my own." "Sorry..." she added. Kim took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, if ever I could kill that Proctor I would a hundred times..." Ara and Kim heard a screaming sound. They turned towards the shoe department door they'd shut behind them. A hollowed figure stood gazing hungrily through the glass. "What the fuck is that?" said Kim. Ara was shocked Kim had said that, even in post war cultures cussing was still a big dramatization. "That, would be our ticket to leave." "Shit the shoes!" said Kim as they began to run to the back towards the back. Ara knew the severity of every moment of her life, but to hear this burly woman complain about shoes and the lack thereof was definitely on the top list of funniest thing's she'd heard. "Forget them!" It pained her to say so. They both ran to the back and tried to unlock the manager's door. They knew that if they got in their they could either fend off the monster or wait for Will and Roger, as they knew where they were and would most likely have weapons. Ara tried to bust down the door with her bare foot finding the door quite resilient. Kim saw what she was doing and join her pounding the door with her shoulders. The glass broke as the mumbler came running down the store his screams becoming more audible. "Fuck fuck fuck!" Ara said as she made kicked harder at the door. As the mumbler reached the counter it tried to jump at them. Both Kim and Ara braced against the door screaming as the mumbler made air. BANG. The mumbler hit both of them with a resounding thud. Ara quickly tried to grab the mumbler by the neck so that it couldn't bite her, a method her father had shown her, and found... It was now missing. Kim registered in the haze of commotion a figure in the back pull a rifle out and shoot at it's head.  She'd been too distracted at the disgusting once human meat bag falling on her. Getting nasty all over the new clothes Kim had grabbed, to really get a good look at the figure. Ara put the dead body down as she got up to see who had saved them. No one was there. "Kim." Said Ara. "I saw him." "Him?" "Or whatever, I saw a person in a black robe shoot with a gun." "And then he took off?" "I guess." Ara helped Kim up. They both quickly ran to the front of the store to see if they could find their hooded rescuer. Ara stared through the glass but could see nothing. She placed her hands on the glass, it felt warmer in the area than anywhere else. "Kim?" "Yes?" do your feet feel kinda toasty?" "Toasty?" "Like warm?" Taking a moment to feel them. "Yeah... What do you think it means?" "I don't know." Said Ara walking towards their basket. "But we need to go, this place isn't safe and we need to find Will. Who knows what that boy is up to.""And then I said to her: 'Is that my mother's thong?' and she said: 'Try not to think about it.' ". Roger started laughing. He knew not if she had grasped the plot of his story, but he knew she found it funny. "You know Roger? I think it's funny how we don't speak the same dialect, but we still speak the same language, and yet we still have an idea of what the other person is talking about. Get me?" "Roger" she said as she leaned out of the cart and grabbed all of the spools of copper she could levy herself to grab. "Good thing we found a Radio Shack, this store is right up your alley." Roger beamed at Will. Will pictured in his head that this is what being an older brother must feel like.  "You know, if I could have had you as a baby... Sorry little..." Will saw death in Roger's eyes as he switched words. ".. sister I would." Roger stopped sorting through the diode's section a moment and tiptoed carefully through the cart to hug Will. "Roger" she said. Will hugged her back glad that he and Roger had connected, despite the amounts of crazy abuse she had at first put him through. As Roger went back to collecting diodes in a tiny tackle box Will said: "I think we just had a serious moment there, I don't know if I can handle the emotional bond we just made." He said in a silly attitude. Roger just giggled. What a delightful girl thought Will. BANG! Will turned the cart around immediately making Roger almost tumble out. He began running with the cart towards the front of the door. Roger just held on tight sorting through the materials and tools handing Will one of the hammers they'd found. Damn, she's on point too: thought Will. They had wandered out of the hardware store as soon as Roger saw a flyer for RadioShack and they'd decided while the girls were busy to go grab more electronics for Roger to gut. The mall was an absolute maze designed to trap people in and by the time the shoe store was within sight the girls had just walked out with their shoes. "What happened?" said Will as he continued to dash towards Ara. "A random stranger shot a mumbler before it could get us." "What?" "Yeah, some random hooded figure shot a mumbler right in front of us and then took off." "Why?" Both Kim and Ara shoulder shrugged, Roger imitated them. "Anyways, here's your shoes babe." Said Ara handing him a pair of bright green sneakers. "Are you serious?" "They were out of your size." Said Ara laughing. "I need to speak to a manager." Said Will pretending to walk in. Ara and Roger laughed. Kim didn't quite get it. Will sat down on the floor to quickly put on the sneakers as Ara gave Roger her tiny shoes. "Why is the floor warm?" said Will after a moment. "Don't know." Said Kim again shrugging. She must have learned that from Ara. Thought Will. Roger picked some of the backpacks they had found and tossed them to each of the members. Kim said " Why do we need these?" Ara, Roger, and Will had a moment of silence. It had not occurred to them that maybe Kim didn't understand the impact of where and what they did for a living. Kim could only see stares. "Hello?" Will snapped out of it. "Kim... This just occurred to us.." he looked at Ara. "Have you ever been outside of the Settlement?" "Well yeah, when I was little, but I don't remember much. " Ara came up towards her. "Remember that thing that just ran at us?" "Yeah?" "That is the least frightening thing you will encounter out here, save for this little monster who scared the bejeezus out of us." Kim's eyes widened. Will shrugged. "We have to pack tools and equipment just to survive. Not to mention..." Everyone's stomach rumbled as if on queue. "Ah man..." said Will. "I just remembered we lost all of the food. And the Titans! I just remembered that too!" The girls stared at Will. "I really forget that y'all have no concept of culture." Said Will packing his backpack. Kim looked at Ara. "This is the man you sleep with?" with her eyebrow raised. "Whoa whoa whoa, there is a child among us." Said Ara putting her hands over Roger's ears. Will put his own hands on his ears. "I'm offended." He said. Ara gave him a look, Will only smiled. "Maybe two children." She said laughing. Kim laughed it off too. "Sorry, in the Settlement were able to speak freely about such things." "We try to keep it PG here." Said Will. He slapped his forehead. "Dammit, forgot again." Ara addressed the group "On a serious note: Food." Roger said: "Roger Roger Tango Bravo!" "I think she means there' a food court down the way." Said Will. "When did you learn to speak Roger?" said Ara. Will pulled Roger from the cart and then handed her the over stuffed backpack she would attempt to carry. "We bonded, were homies now." Ara shook her head. Kim had begun to walk ahead brandishing her new machete. "Hey, it's warmer this way." She said as the rest slowly made their way towards her. "I wonder if it's that guy, maybe he puts off a lot of heat?" Everyone had a round of shrugs. They're really starting to grow on me. Thought Will. As they walked closer to the food courts the heat began to pickup. They stood in the center of the court looking around them at what could possibly have something considerably edible. "I don't know what that is, but I definitely don't like it." Said Ara looking at the walls and ceiling surrounding them. Black goo seemed to suspend there motionless. Will looked at the restaurants trying to make a good pick. "Hmmm... I'm not really feeling Asian food, ChickFilet isn't my style either." He spotted a restaurant with golden arcs. "Aha, I'm sure their food is still good. Let's hope those preservatives have kept it edible. Will and company approached the counter. Will stopped in front of it and looked over the counter. "What are you doing?" said Kim "Hello? I'd like to place an order, is there anyone here?" he said jokingly. To everyone's surprise a black robed figure popped out of the door a few seconds later wearing a chef apron and a pop-up paper hat assumedly from another restaurant nearby. "What can I get for you?" said the man. Will almost fainted. Kim held her machete up ready to attack. Ara and Roger just stood their dumbfounded. The man was a big plump gentleman probably in his late thirties, he wore tiny beady glasses on his fat balding head. He seemed to really have problems breathing as he seemed asthmatic. He had pathy scruff all along the underside of his chin and around to his bushy chops. If Will had not been completely surprised at the man's appearance he would have totally described this guy as Darth Vader the Neckbeard. "I'm just shitting with you, there's no food here." Said the guy. "The name's Mandry." He said extending his fat hand to Will. "Will" Will shook it with an uneasy laugh. "Are you the guy who shot the mumbler?" said Ara. Kim still sat with her arm macheteed and ready. "Oh you mean that zombie?" he said. "Yes, that was me m'lady." He said tipping the hat towards him. "Thank you. I'm Ara, and this is Kim and Roger" Said Ara looking briefly to Kim to pipe her aggression down. "Roger!" said Roger. Mandry coughed a pretty severe cough. "Are you okay man?" said Will as Mandry went through the kitchen door to grab something. He returned apron-less and hatless with his rifle over his shoulder. He gently placed his hood on his head. "I'm fine. Anyone hungry?" he said cheerfully. "Uh, yes?" said Ara looking uneasily at Will. "Right this way!" said Mandry walking away. Kim looked at him and then back to the group. "Are you sure we should trust him?" Another round of shrugging ensued. "Sometimes you have to go on faith." Said Will grabbing Ara's hand. She felt touched he was referring to her. "Yeah, I guess sometimes you do." Roger walked forward and grabbed Kim's hand, leading her towards the hobbling fat man. It wasn't hard to catch up to him, he didn't move far. He looked back to see if his guests had followed and saw what appeared to be the assemble to the yellow brick road behind him. He laughed inside his head. They looked silly to him. He huffed and puffed up the escalator, pausing a brief moment to catch his breath. As they came closer and closer to his lair the air became heavy. Something seemed wrong. He stopped in front of the Security room's door and loosened his Batman cape. "The little one will have to stay here, I don't want her getting too close to it." "It?" said Will. "You'll see." He said. He caught himself, realizing his position. "Look, I have food that I'd like to get to feed you guys, but in order to do so I need to walk into my lab where I have been working and it's now highly dangerous for her to walk in. Y'all will be fine, she will not." "No way, I am not going in there." Said Kim crossing her arms. "That's fine, I only need two of you. You can both leave your backpacks here." Ara and Will looked at each other. This seemed like a trap. Roger pouted realizing she wasn't going to see the cool room. Will looked at Kim as he handed her his backpack. "Go ahead and stay with Roger, if anything happens I don't want her to be alone." Mandry leaned his gun against the wall as Ara set her backpack down. He reached in his bathrobe pocket and relieved a set of keys, the guys seriously must have been a janitor here, or an IT guy at least. As he opened the door the heat swelled a bit, he dropped his robe on the inside of the door as he walked into the dark room. Ara and Will walked after him into the pitch dark as he sat down at a desk. He turned on the monitor and to the surprise of Ara and Will it came to life. He logged into the blue screen and opened an application. Ara and Will had closed the door behind them and they both sat standing next to Mandry removing their stuffy jackets. Mandry began clicking switches on the application and all of the lights in the room began to turn on. The room they were in was full of equipment and Ethernet cable with monitors everywhere. Behind them a break room appeared full of coffee machines, a fridge, and a snack machine. Mandry walked to the door and grabbed his jacket waddling back to the vending machine and one again producing his keys. The vending machine was stocked full of junk food and it seemed he had been refilling it for years with the snacks he'd pillaged from the mall. On the walls of the room were posters of half naked girls, weird half human half animal transgender art that made Ara want to gag, and Star Wars original trilogy posters. "Nice Star Wars posters." Said Will as Mandry started pilling food into his jacket he'd laid on the breakroom table. Mandry seemed surprised: "Not many fellows your age know what that is, I'm surprised." He paused. "Then again, I'm not sure I've ever encountered anyone your age that wasn't a zombie or a weird mutant." "How many people have you encountered?" Mandry sat there mulling it over in his mind. "Five." Ara and Will's eyebrows raised. "Only five?" "Yep, and y'all are the first group I've encountered. Well, let me rephrase.." he said. "Y'all are the only REAL people I've met. I know some guys on the internet and there's always the dark children from the Settlement, but they don't count. I only catch them in my traps, never alive. "Traps?" said Ara. "INTERNET?" said Will. "Yeah traps, meant for zombies and the like, but every once and a while I'll find someone's caught in my traps. Sad day." He rested against the counter from all the labor of him moving snacks into his robe. Will just continued to stare. "Are we going to skip over the fact that the internet is still running?" said Will after a generous five seconds. "Well yeah, some of the servers are still running and since the satellites haven't totally been out of orbit my Wifi module has been working for years." Will pulled one of the chairs from the break room table and sat down as if his entire life had been a lie. "Cellphones?" Mandry pulled out a beat up flip phone. "Yeah, I text my buddies every morning and afternoon to see if their still alive." "You have friends?" said Ara, realizing she may have made that sound bad. "Well yeah I have friends", said Mandry opening the phone and taking a picture of the two of them. "Boy, the guys are going to think this is hysterical. The moment I told y'all the internet was still a thing. And just think there are people out there like primitive animals fighting with spears and I have a heated building with working toilets." "You have a toilet?" Mandry put coffee in the coffee machine. "And somewhat of clean water too, but I mostly drink it in coffee, gotta heat it up just in case." The coffee machine sprung to life and began to heat water. "This is amazing." Said Will forgoing his paining stomach. "You've had this all to yourself?" "Yep, since day one. Me and the lady have shared this for a while, just by ourselves." "The lady?" said Ara taking her eyes away from the weird erotic pictures on the wall. "Yeah, I've been watching her for some time, I'll take you to meet her after we eat." The door to the security room opened as Kim entered holding her machete. "What's going on?" she said as she spotted the two teens and the big fat adult. He poured a cup of coffee in a cup as he answered. "Nuthin' much." Ara and Will stared at Kim, she had no idea how weird all of this was. Kim put down her machete once she say the pile of food. "Is that?" "For you?" said Mandry, "Yes." Kim looked around the room at the strange machines and posters a particular one caught her eye, the same distorted one Ara had been looking at. She blushed. Mandry looked at her and said: "That's why I didn't think the little girl needed to come in." said Mandry walking out of the breakroom with his jacket-o-snacks. Will asked: "May have a cup of Joe?" as Mandry opened the security door. "Sure!" he said as if everything was normal. Ara stared at Will as he made his coffee and then came over to Kim to study the same piece of "art" that had caught both of their interests. "Sick shit huh?" she said as she headed to the door to help Roger put food in their bags. "Yeah.." said Kim looking shameful. Ara didn't notice as the door shut behind her, but Will had watched the confrontation and he finally got it. He walked over to Kim, who was currently looking at her feet. He placed a hand on her shoulder. "Kim, your not really... You know... are you?" Kim recoiled her shoulder and backed up. "Ofcourse I am...." She said making for the door. Will gently held his cup. "I know why you wear guy's jeans Kim, I get it and there's no reason to be ashamed." "It's a mutation." She said shamefully as she put her hand on the door. "It may be, but it's one that existed before the end. Your normal." Will followed after her as she tried to pass of his comment. Ara and Roger were stuffing their bags and Mandry sat on the escalator looking out over his kingdom. Will came up behind him and placed a hand on his shoulder. "Hey, I appreciate what you're doing for us. There's no way we can repay you." "You know..." said the fat man turning around slightly. "I've been hear for more than a decade sitting here basically alone imagining I have friends and imagining great times I had meeting travelers worn by the chaotic world outside. I always imagined that I'd be in some way able to help them, and that maybe for that they'd like me." Will sipped his coffee. "I never had friends before the end, save for the guys in Dallas who happen to still run the Internet on this side of the world. And I always felt like maybe if I could help someone they'd like me for that." "We do." Said Ara listening in on the conversation. "Roger" said the Twinkie stuffed mouth of Roger. "That means a lot to me." Said Mandry. "I'm so very happy to have been helpful, hello this is the first time I've felt good in ages." Mandry slowly picked himself up. He looked back at his new friends. "I've got something I'd like to show you." He said. The group followed Mandry with their backpacks as he hobbled slowly down the long courts. Down the hall a dumpster truck sat blocking a once metal covered window. Next to the vehicle was a large container, most likely escorted into here by said truck. "What is that?" said Will, noticing the noise growing as well as the large container shedding light in one direction. "That's my power source." Said Mandry picking up his excited pace. Ara thought he was referring to the container and very soon realized that it was the hallway blocked off past the large container. Groans and moans assured them that Mnadry had an army of moaners and mumblers behind a mall screen door. Next to it sat a generator hooked to lots of wires. "When all hell broke loose I locked myself in that security room for years." Said Mandry. "The whole mall soon became infected by these guys so I started slowly baiting them to this hall. It was a slow and dangerous process, but I got all of these zombies into here after I set up the treadmills." "Treadmills?" said Kim holding Roger by the shoulder so she would not get closer to the gate. "Yeah! My energy source!" The group peered could see the entire wall had been lined by treadmills. "Foxtrot!" said Roger suddenly getting the notion. The group of zombies perpetually seemed to walk their way stumbling over each other as the back drove the treadmills motors. "You see, they think they are slowly walking towards food all the time because of my lady over here..." he said pointing behind him. "But really they are just keeping me happy and well with electricity." Kim looked behind her back at the container. It hadn't occurred to anyone as they had passed the container to actually look at once they had passed it, they had been too preoccupied with the army of zombies. "What is that?" she said releasing Roger's shoulder. Mandry turned and walked with Kim towards the bright light that illuminated the room. "That is my Sleeping Beauty." He said looking up at the suspended figure. Ara and Will grabbed Roger as they walked back at the glowing suspended woman. Suspended in fluid was a bald woman covered in a suspension fluid. She sat listlessly as her arms and legs were suspended by large clamps in the tank the container housed. A status screen and heart monitor sat underneath her. She seemed to be wearing a pearl suit that covered her beautiful figure. "Who is she?" said Kim staring at wonder at the beautiful sleeping figure. "Who knows, I've never woken her up. I did all this to give her container power." Mandry said fluttering his arms about at the power rig he'd set up. "Not to say she hasn't helped." He said pointing out he'd been using her as bait for years. The woman had a mask on her face that covered her nose and mouth, she had what looked to be surgical scars and a tag on her ear. "Are you ever going to wake her up?" said Will holding Ara close to him. "I considered it." Said Mandry. "But then I remembered what world we lived in and who would be her savior. And both those things are ugly." He said with a chuckle. "I thought it better to let her sleep and dream of a better world." Kim looked angrily at Mandry. "Sounds more like slavery and power play. You wake her and she leaves, no more power, no more beautiful girl." Mandry started to sweat. "You could look at it that way, but would it be so wrong if that was the case?" He backed up slightly. "I think it would be wrong." Said Kim looking back at the beautiful lady. "This woman hasn't been able to live in years. She should have the right to try and survive as we do!" Ara and Will stepped in between. "Kim calm down, Mandry was trying to act in her best interest." "You mean HIS best interest said Kim brandishing her fists. Mandry slunk back a ways. While all of this conflict was occurring no one had been keeping tabs on Roger as she went up to the screen. She knew not the words, but she understood the options the screen presented to her. She looked over at the cowering man Mandry was hiding behind Ara and she saw the quite overzealous Kim reliving her repressed former life. She paused a moment before she clicked the touch screen. She knew she was not the god of anyone's fate, but neither were they. "Awake."?Chapter 11:"From a single point in space I float. I exist solely in this infinite universe fixed to this one point. Though it seems as if the whole universe is revolving around me, I revolve around it as well. Together we create and destroy; together we react to each other an endless collision of reactions. Is the universe an entity to be encountered or am I the universe? Do I exist, or am I a simulation. Or was that existence in the first place? Just a simulation designed to extrapolate what existence on this plane would be like. Maybe there are gods that determine this, maybe there are no gods to determine whether I am real. What if I'm god? What if I'm god and all of the thoughts and dreams I have are what creates the universe around me. Do I cause chaos or destruction with my universal thoughts, my infinite queries?  If I determine my actions, than what is dictated for me? Am I the only entity alone in this vacuum of darkness, only illuminated by my own dreams? I feel restricted by my surroundings, but free-floating like a god. But what if I am a god. What if I'm THE god? Oh no, that would be an awful responsibility. Are there multiple? Does the universe have a finite amount of gods or gods per universal unit? Maybe there's another god; who won't make me lonely. Maybe there's another god who will create and destroy with me. Their reaction will become a reaction from me and my actions will react with them causing more reactions than were previously possible! Or maybe I'm alone in this universe. Maybe I'm dead. What was living? Was it a good life I once had? Do lives do that? What was my name? Do I have one now? Or am I just an anomaly like everything else assigned an arbitrary value for reference?  Am I living now, suspended, in a reality caused by another entity? Or did I do this upon myself? Will I ever know?"BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP"Pain. Ow. My senses are hurting me. What is that?

The blaring of the container incited the mumblers as the contents began to slowly drain unto the floor. The liquid that had once harbored the floating being became an overwhelming mucky mess on the floor causing the onlookers to slowly step forward as the pool congealed around them. All disputes and quarrels were set aside for the birthing of "AAA". Mostly."Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck.." continued Mandry. He held his fat head in his hands pacing as the AAA Project container reached near empty and the lung machine stopped whirring. This was the real thing, a real sentient android was about to be born right in front of his eyes. Ara and Will held Roger by her shoulder and Kim seemed almost as impatient and scared as Mandry. Ara studied Kim's demeanor, she seemed almost intrinsically fascinated with this creature. Could she be?... No, couldn't possibly. Will looked at Kim as she moved from undoing her hair to putting back and then repeating the process. Everyone was nervous, but damn. Then it clicked. Will's eyes narrowed, he got it. This was a being who looked past classification... Even gender. If this creature was actually sentient then it would forgo all predetermined judgments that we would have. He glanced at Ara who had a puzzled look on her face. She was trying to figure it out as well. But she hadn't been there in the conference room, she didn't know the true Kimarus. Aggripa, Ah Alta (feetfirst)(young one)(elevated) The android will awaken and begin taking in information at once. Imediately she will attempt a visual, auditory, and tactile test followed by a oral confirmation. Every word spoken she will try to create a language database using natural language processing. She makes exceptions in Roger's speech because Roger is speaking in a code. The android will create a database of Roger's language and the other's language and will compare the two to understand it. Much like a child she is receptive to her environment. She becomes aware of motality when Mandry dies and hurts herself to see if she too is mortal. To her great fear she realizes that she is near imartal, but not invulnerable. She will learn what love is from Ara and Will, as misguided as that may be and will fall in love with Kim. The android's memory will be a series of svm's andHere
